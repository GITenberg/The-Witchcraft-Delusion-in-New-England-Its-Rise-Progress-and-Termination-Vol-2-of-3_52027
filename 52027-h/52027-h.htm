Object in this Edition
of Mr. Calef's Work is
similar to that in Dr.
Mather's in the preceding
Volume, namely, to give
a perfectly accurate Reprint
of the Work; so that whoever has
Occasion to use or consult it may do so
with entire Confidence. I have therefore
reprinted the original Edition of
1700, with such Notes as was judged
might be useful to a certain Class of
Readers. And having mentioned the
Notes, I will say of them here all I
have to say about them. There may be
those who have no need of such Additions.
They can pass them by unheeded;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>
but it was thought generally that a few Explanations
and Additions would be a Help
to the Party consulting the Work. They
have been made as brief as was thought
consistent with the Subject.</p>

<p>With respect to the original Text, it is
given as exactly like the Original as a
much better Type can be made to imitate
an old Type of 166 Years ago. As to
retaining all the Errors in the original
Edition, it was thought incompatible with
the general good Taste of the Age.
Some, of a peculiar Nature, if judged
necessary to show a Peculiarity of the
Times, may have been retained, and
noted for such Peculiarity; but a broken
or imperfect Letter is discarded as unworthy
of Imitation; so transposed or
inverted Letters are set right, as any good
proof Reader would have done, had he
noticed them in the Original; but the
Orthography of that Day is scrupulously
retained.</p>

<p>Why there was no Edition of the
<i>More Wonders of the Invisible World</i>, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">vii</a></span>
ninety-six Years, will be found elsewhere
explained. The Edition of 1796 is the first
American Edition. This bears the following
Imprint: "<span class="smcap">Printed in London in</span> the
Year 1700. | <i>Reprinted in</i> SALEM, <i>Massachusetts</i>,
1796, | By WILLIAM CARLTON.
| <i>Sold at</i> <span class="smcap">Cushing &amp; Carlton's</span>
<i>Book Store, at the Bible</i> | <i>and Heart, Essex-Street.</i>"
The Volume is in Duodecimo,
and contains 318 Pages. The second
Salem Edition is in the same Form, and
contains 309 Pages, exclusive of the Article
headed "<span class="smcap">Giles Cory</span>," which occupies
three Pages; hence Copies of this Edition
contain 312 Pages. Its Imprint&mdash;all in
small Capitals&mdash;is thus: "Printed in
London, A. D. 1700. | Reprinted in Salem,
by John D. and T. C. Cushing, Jr. |
for Cushing and Appleton. 1823." The
Publishers of this Edition added the Article
<i>Giles Cory</i>, at the Suggestion of <span class="smcap">Mr.
David Pulsifer</span>, then employed in the
Office where the <i>Witchcraft Records</i> were
kept, as he many Years ago informed
me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>

The second Salem Edition appears to
have been copied from the first&mdash;that of
1796. In some Instances slight Departures
are made from the Copy; and in
all these, such Departures are also Departures
from the Original. As late as
1796, it might be expected that some
Uniformity would have been observed, as
long as no Exactness was intended in
respect to the kind of Type used in
reprinting an old Work&mdash;Uniformity in
denoting Quotations; but there is no
Exactness in this respect in either Edition.
In the first, as will be seen, sometimes
Brackets are used to distinguish Quotations,
but generally italic Type is employed for
that Purpose. In the second, inverted
Commas are generally used, sometimes
Brackets. I have followed the Original,
bracketing and italicising as I find it.
Inverted Commas to denote Extracts,
Quotations and the possessive Case of
Nouns have been introduced by Writers
and Printers mainly, since the Time of
Mr. Calef.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">ix</a></span>

Nothing appears in the Book to show
whether the Author superintended the
printing of it or otherwise. He may
have resided in London at the Time of
its Publication, although there are some
Considerations that seem to lead to
the Conclusion that it may have passed
through the Press without his Supervision;
but, as before observed, Nothing is known
in regard to it, and it is not very probable
that Anything more will ever come to
Light; yet equally strange Things as that
would be, have happened.</p>

<p>Taking Liberties with old Authors is
exceedingly distasteful to me, even where
well assured that an Author would have
gladly made a Change himself, had a
Defect or Deformity been noticed by
him; but I have not even assumed that
Responsibility in Mr. Calef's Work. I
have done one Thing which the Student
ought to thank me for, though he may
not. I have placed the Headings of the
different Sections at the Commencement
of those Sections, throughout the Work.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">x</a></span>
In the original Edition these were omitted,
probably on the score of Economy. They
also stand at the Commencement of the
Book (as in the Original,) entitled "Index."
The Benefit to the Reader, in
reprinting the Captions or Contents of a
Section or Chapter over such Section or
Chapter will be too apparent to require
Apology.</p>

<p>The Pagination of the Original is Exactly
retained; being placed at the top
inner Margin in Brackets, and in the Page
where the original Page begins and ends,
as was done in the previous Volume.</p>

<p>
<img src="images/illus_014b.jpg" width="100" height="94" alt="W" class="floatl" />
HEN any Man has moral Courage
enough to speak plainly
against any Vices, Follies, or
Superstitions surrounding him,
he must not only be a bold
Man, but he does so regardless
of the Cost; for all Experience
teaches that whoever undertakes a Reformation
of the Kind must experience a Fate not altogether
unlike him who waged War with the Philistines.</p>

<p>If the Reformer escapes the Fury of the Deluded,
and lives out his natural Time, he often
loses his social standing; is maligned, scoffed, and
scorned by all whom he exposed, and a Multitude
of those who follow them as their Leaders without
knowing wherefore. It is much the same
now. The Reformer or Corrector of Opinion is
hissed and slandered in Proportion to the Effort he
makes. That is to say, he is dealt with by Society
leniently if he tells the Truth with a Sort of
Proviso; maintains his Position without Firmness,
and gains but few Followers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">xii</a></span>

Little is known of Robert Calef, aside from
his single Book, and what his Enemies have
thought proper to say about him in a bitter Spirit
of Detraction. He was certainly a Man of good
Education; but how he acquired it, where and
when, no Mention is found. Dr. Mather, in his
Rejoinder to the <i>More Wonders</i>, assails him at
every Point; but his Attainments in Literature he
probably viewed as not vulnerable, as he has
made no Attack on that Quarter. It is true he
accuses him of being assisted in his Labors, but
gives no Clue by which such Assistance may be
known.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding Mr. Calef had, by his Independence
in freely arraigning the absurd Proceedings
against those charged with imaginary Crimes,
he was not without some Popularity in Boston,
his Place of Residence, at the Period of those
Prosecutions; for in the Records of the Town
are found the following Entries concerning him:
April 16th, 1694, "Mr. Robert Calfe was chosen
Hayward &amp; Fence-viewer, in the Room of Mr.
Edward Wyllys, who refused to serve." May
12th, 1702, he was added to the Number of the
Overseers of the Poor. On the 19th of April,
1704, Thanks were voted him for his Services in
that Office. On March 12th, 1704-5, it was
ordered that Mr. Calef be not charged with Interest
on Moneys remaining in his Hands. The
next Year, March 10th, 1706-7, he was chosen
one of the Assessors, but declined the Service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">xiii</a></span>

The Time of the Emigration of the Family
of Calef, or Calfe, to this Country has not been
ascertained, nor has there been published any
considerable Memorial of it. The Name is an
old English one; and were Time bestowed upon
it, many Items might doubtless be found in old
Authors of Persons who have borne it. At Present
but a Reference or two must suffice. In
the Time of Henry III (1216-1270), a Sir John
<i>Calfe</i> flourished, on whom a curious Epitaph may
be seen in <i>Camden's Remains</i>. Another John
Calfe has an Inscription to his Memory in St.
Nicholas's Church, London, giving 1426 as the
Year of his Decease.</p>

<p>It is not very remarkable that so little is known
of Robert Calef, when it is considered that he
had almost the entire Community against him.
And less is learned about him than might be
expected in the Perusal of his own Book. That
his Character was above Reproach is evident from
the Replies of Dr. Mather and his Friends, to
his Questions respecting the Proofs of Witchcraft.
It helps one's Cause but very little, merely to call
his Antagonist "a Lyar;" and this appears to have
been the heaviest Argument brought against Mr.
Calef in Answer to his Statements.</p>

<p>In Dr. Mather's Account of the <i>Afflictions</i> of
Margaret Rule, he thus refers to those who differ
from him; undoubtedly having special Reference
to Mr. Calef: "Yea, to do like Satan himself, by
sly, base unpretending Insinuations, as if I wore not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">xiv</a></span>
the Modesty and Gravity which became a Minister
of the Gospel, I could not but think myself unkindly
dealt withal, and the Neglects of others to
do me Justice in this Affair has caused me to conclude
this Narrative in <i>another hearing</i> of such
monstrous Injuries."</p>

<p>By "another hearing," is meant that he had or
would take legal Steps to silence his Opponent;
for about the same Time the Doctor was so annoyed
by certain Queries sent him by Mr. Calef,
that he returned him Word by his (Mr. Calef's)
Bearer, that he would have him arrested for Slander,
as he was "one of the worst of Lyars." This
the Doctor proclaimed also in his Pulpit. Yet
Mr. Calef was always respectful in his Language
in return, for anything that appears to the contrary.</p>

<p>On the 29th of September, 1693, Mr. Calef
addressed Dr. Mather a Note, requesting that he
would meet him at either of the Booksellers,
Richard Wilkins or Benjamin Harris. Mr. Calef
desired this Meeting that they might examine
together the Memoranda of what he had noted
after visiting the "possessed" or bewitched Person,
Margaret Rule. At that Visit were also both the
Doctors Mather, Father and Son. Meantime Mr.
Calef was complained of and taken into Custody,
on the Charge of having committed a scandalous
Libel on Mr. Mather the younger; the Complaint
being made by both. Mr. Calef states
that he did not remember that he had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">xv</a></span>
charged with Untruth in his Report of the Examination
of Margaret; but it was asserted that
he had wronged Dr. Mather by his Omissions.
To which Mr. Calef replied, that he had reported
only what <i>he</i> saw and heard himself.</p>

<p>As to the Prosecution for Libel, Mr. Calef
says he was taken to the Court of Sessions, and
after waiting a while for his Accusers, none appeared.
He was therefore dismissed. He had
had a Promise from Dr. Mather to meet him to
compare Notes, but it does not appear that any
Time was stated; and after several Months had
elapsed Mr. Calef wrote, requesting him to fix
upon a Time and Place of Meeting. A Meeting
however never occurred, of the Kind desired;
but, as the only Means of getting the Doctor's
Views of what he had written, he sent him a
Copy of his Notes on Margaret Rule's Exhibitions,
two of which he seems to have witnessed.
On the 15th of January, 1693-4, the Doctor
wrote him a long Letter, in which he says: "I
have this to say, as I have often already said, that
do I scarcely find any one Thing in the whole
Paper, whether respecting my Father or self, either
fairly or truly represented." The <i>Fairness</i> on
both Sides may be judged of, as both Papers will
be found in the ensuing Work, Pages 13-22.</p>

<p>The Doctor sent the Author, accompanying
his Letter, Copies of three Depositions, or Statements
from several Persons, to the Effect that
what he had stated regarding the strange Conduct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">xvi</a></span>
of Margaret Rule was true; especially as to the
Fact, that she was by invisible Hands raised from
her Bed up to the Garret Floor, and that strong
Men, the Bystanders, could not hold her down.
The Height of the Room is not mentioned; but
one Witness, Samuel Aves, says it was "a great
Way;" that she was lifted "towards the Top of
the Room." Three others said, this was "in Substance
true." Also, Thomas Thornton, a Paver,
said she was lifted up, "so as to touch the Garret
Floor;" to which William Hudson assented in
"Substance." All of which Testimonies, Mr.
Calef ventured to insinuate was about as true, as a
Report would be that Iron would swim on Water;
that if that Rising in the Air without Hands
actually took place, it was a Miracle, and if a
Miracle it was wrought by the Devil. And yet
it seems that Mr. Calef believed none but God
himself could work Miracles.</p>

<p>Between the Date of his last Letter and the
19th of February, 1693-4, instead of answering
Mr. Calef's Letter, Dr. Mather sent him Word
that his Library was open to him, intimating that
he might find there Answers to any and all of his
Objections and Difficulties. But Mr. Calef did
not avail himself of the Kindness thus tendered,
though he thanked him by Letter, and at the
same Time complained that he had not written
him, pointing out what he conceived to be Errors
in his former Communications; adding, "if
you think Silence a Virtue in this Case, I shall (I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">xvii</a></span>
suppose) so far comply with it as not to loose you
any more Time to look over my Papers." This
however did not end the Correspondence; for on
the 16th of April following he addressed a Letter
to the Doctor, calling his Attention to certain
Passages in the <i>Wonders of the Invisible World</i>, and
some other "late Books of his and his Relations."
After stating a few of the Author's strange Assertions,
such as that the Devil causes Wars, Plagues,
and other Calamities; that the Devil is a great
Linguist; that Suicides "are the Effects of a
cruel &amp; bloody Witchcraft," and several other
similar Quotations. In closing this Letter, he
remarks that he is only performing what he believes
to be his Duty; that he is far from doing
it to gain Applause, or from a Love of Contention;
that, on the other Hand, he expected to
make many Enemies by it.</p>

<p>The next Letter which he wrote to Mr. Mather
was dated March the 1st, 1694-5. In this
he says he had waited more than a Year "for the
Performance of a reiterated Promise" from him,
to reply to Arguments which he had sent for his
Refutation or Approval. Instead of that promised
Answer, he had received, through the
Hand of a third Person, "four Sheets of recinded
Papers." These were delivered under an
Injunction that no Copy was to be taken of them,
and he was allowed to keep them but a Fortnight.
He has given some Account of those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">xviii</a></span>"four Sheets," and observes that he does not wonder
at not being allowed to copy them, as they
contained so much "crude Matter and impertinent
Absurdities." Among other Things, he sent Mr.
Calef Baxter's <i>World of Spirits</i>, characterizing it
an <i>ungainsayable</i> Book; upon which Mr. Calef
remarks, as aptly as significantly, that he knows
of no "ungainsayable" Book but the Bible, and
thinks no other Man who had ever read it would
so style it except its Author. He is probably
correct when he attributes to Mr. Baxter the
Weakness incident to old Age, in allowing his
Name to appear as the Author of <i>The Certainty
of the World of Spirits</i>. But his own Words
are more to the Point: "As to the sometime
Reverend Author, let his Works praise the Remembrance
of him; but for such as are either
Erroneous and foisted upon him, or the Effect of
an aged Imbecility, let them be detected that they
may proceed no further."</p>

<p>The Experience of Mr. Calef was similar,
probably, to that of most Reformers, both before
and since his Time. To combat similar Superstitions
at this Day would be nearly or quite as
hazardous as it was then. Indeed, there have
been Cases within some thirty Years in New
England, in which Individuals have fared much
worse than Robert Calef did in Boston more
than an hundred Years before, and for no offence
worthy of Notice; neither had an Eighth of the
Community a Voice in this Persecution, while in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">xix</a></span>Mr. Calef's Case nine Tenths of the whole People
probably were crying out against him. The
Villainy of a single Lawyer, and the Imbecility
of a Judge may sometimes succeed in ruining for
a Time the Character of any Citizen.</p>

<p>Mr. Calef seems to have been almost alone in
the Warfare he had undertaken. "How Few,"
he says, "are willing to be found opposing such a
Torrent, as knowing, that in so doing, they shall
be sure to meet with Opposition to the utmost,
from the many, both of Magistrates, Ministers and
people; and the name of Sadducee, Atheist, and
perhaps Witch too cast upon them most liberally,
by Men of the highest Profession in Godliness."</p>

<p>Owing to the peculiar State of the Times
when Mr. Calef wrote, he felt himself obliged
to admit a great Deal that a Writer at a later
Day would not have found it Necessary. This
will account for some heavy Papers introduced
into the Body of his Work. He had a most
difficult Task to perform. Like the Mariner in
a Tempest upon a Lee Shore, he needed an Eye
on every Point of the Compass, and a deep Sea
Lead ever in Hand.</p>

<p>What Overtures, if any, he made to Printers in
Boston to print his Books, are unknown. It is
pretty certain, however, that no One would have
dared to undertake it. And what Agency, if any,
he employed to have it done Abroad, is equally
unknown. But one Thing is known; no Bookseller
had the Hardihood to offer it for Sale, or
dared to give it Shop-room. He had a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">xx</a></span>
Friends who stood by him, ready to shield him,
as far as was consistent with their own Safety, but
none had the Boldness to come out so openly as
he did. Some wrote strongly against the Delusion,
but not for Publication; as Brattle of Cambridge,
Cary of Charlestown, and Robert Paine.
The Work of the last named Gentleman has not
been made public, and remains in private Hands.
It is said to be a most masterly Refutation of the
Arguments made use of against Witches, written
in the Time of the Trials. But it seems, on a
careful Perusal of Mr. Calef's <i>More Wonders</i>, that
not much more can be said (admitting or deferring
to a Sort of Authority which cannot be
argued from,) to show the utter Absurdity of the
Proceedings on the Witch Trials. He has, it
must be admitted, exhausted the Subject. It is
very easy, it is true, to say the same Thing, using
different and more elegant Language, according
to the present Standard of Elegance; but for close
and succinct Argument, the Author has not been
surpassed by his Successors. His Statement of
Apology for those poor People who had confessed
themselves Witches, and accused others, is highly
satisfactory.</p>

<p>Mr. Calef possessed more than ordinary Attainments
in Literature; he was no Stranger to
legal Forms; and as to theological Learning, was,
for Soundness of Argument, quite superior to those
who were in the Field against him. These Facts
excite a Desire to know more of his History;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">xxi</a></span>
for all that has been learned about him, is that he
was a "Merchant of Boston," and that he was a
Dealer in woolen Goods; and hence the Attempt
of a narrow minded Opposition to class him
among the Ordinary and Illiterate of the Time.
They also descended to vulgar Epithets, calling
him a <i>Calf</i>; his Book they call a "Firebrand,
thrown by a Mad-man;" and, "it was highly rejoycing
to us, when we heard that our Booksellers
were so well acquainted with the Integrity
of our Pastors, as not one of them would admit
of those Libels to be vended in their Shops."
This was the Language of the Men who published
"Some few Remarks, upon a <i>Scandalous
Book</i> ... written by one Robert Calef," with
the Motto&mdash;"Truth will come off Conqueror."
This Publication is dated "January 9th, 1700-1,"
and purports to have been drawn up by Obadiah
Gill, John Barnard, John Goodwin, William Robie,
Timothy Wadsworth, Robert Cumbey, and
George Robinson; none of whom were Men of
special Note then or afterwards. It should be
observed, however, that they were Members of
the Old North Church. Any further Notice of
the Answer to the <i>More Wonders</i> is unnecessary
here; but it will be used in the Notes occasionally,
that the "<i>Slandered</i>" may speak for themselves.</p>

<p>It was probably about the Time of the Issue
of the <i>Some Few Remarks</i> that the <i>More Wonders</i>
was caused to be burnt in the College Yard at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">xxii</a></span>
Cambridge, by Order of the President, Dr. Increase
Mather. The Burning was doubtless performed
with much of Ceremony and Formality,
but there does not appear to have been any Record
made of it upon the College Books; or if so,
the Historians of the Institution have not mentioned
it. This Kind of <i>Argument</i> against what
is set forth in a Book, is about as effectual as that
employed against the Tide of the Ocean by an
eastern Monarch. That the President of the
College had no great Faith in his <i>Argument</i>, is
pretty clear, or so much Pains would not have
been taken by him in making another Book to
refute the Arguments contained in the one he
had burned.</p>

<p>The precise Date of Mr. Calef's Death is not
upon any Records which have been examined;
and the last Time he appears to have transacted
any Business requiring his Signature, was at the
Registry of Deeds, then under the official Management
of John Ballantine, Esq., when he
released a Mortgage which he held of certain
Lands in Roxbury; which Mortgage was given
by Joseph Holland and his Wife Elizabeth, and
dated the 11th of March, 1720. [Of course,
1721, N. S.] The Release was signed by the
Mortgagor, April 11th, 1722. His Signature on
this Occasion has been copied, and is here presented.</p>

But a short Time previous to this Transaction
he deeded certain Property to his Children. In
this Instrument, dated February 10th, 1721,
[1722, N. S.,] he styles himself Clothier, and
names Children, Elizabeth, Ann, Margaret and
James. Two Houses and Land; one in present
Possession of James Smith; the other in his own
Possession; bounded N. W. upon&mdash;&mdash;Street, N.
E. upon Thomas Wheeler, S. E. upon William
Gold, and S. W. upon Bond Street; also one
Tract of Land in Brookline; also a Mortgage
from James Barton, Ropemaker, reserving to
himself and his now married Wife the Use of the
Premises during their Lives.</p>

<p>The following is an Abstract of his Will:</p>

<p>The Testator was too ill, it is probable, to draw
up his Will himself, or one so unclerical would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">xxv</a></span>not have appeared. The Circumstances, however,
under which it was made, are entirely conjectural.
His Wife was living, a Widow, till
about 1744; as in September of that Year her
Will was proved. It was made four Years before,
namely, September 17th, 1740. The Items
of Interest in it here follow:</p>

<p>"To Grandson Thomas Green £60; to Margaret
Green £20, and a silver Porringer which
her Father now has. To Ann Green £30, and
a gold Necklace. To Bethiah Green £20. To

Rebeckah Green £30; all the Children of my
Daughter Ann Green deceased. To Daughter
Margaret Star's four Children, namely, to Joseph,

<p>In the General Court Records Notice is given,
under Date June 25th, 1723, of a "Petition of
Margaret Calef, Widow, and sole Executrix of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">xxvi</a></span>
the last Will of Robert Calef, late of Boston,
Merchant, deceased," praying for Leave to sell a
seventh Part of a House and Land in Roxbury,
of which said Robert Calef died seized. The
Father of Mr. Calef, also named Robert, had
died intestate, April 13th, 1719, and his Wife on
the 12th of November following. In the Settlement
of his Estate, it is stated that the "Housing
and Lands lying in Roxbury, cannot be divided
without Prejudice and Injury;" hence the Petition
before mentioned.</p>

<p>A few Items here follow, given for the Benefit
of those who may hereafter desire to investigate
the History of the Calef Family;</p>

<p>Dr. Joseph Calef died at Ipswich, Dec. 31st,
1707, leaving a Wife, and Children, Robert, Joseph,
Samuel, Ebenezer, Peter and Mary. This
was, doubtless the Emigrant to Ipswich, where,
in 1692, he had a Grant for a Fulling-mill. Joseph
Calef was a Scout in Capt. John Goff's
Company in 1746. Mary, Widow of Joseph
Calef, married Thomas Choate of Ipswich; Date
of Marriage is not stated. Joseph Calef was of
Boston, 1746, in which Year he petitioned, with
others, for the Paving of Atkinson Street.</p>

<p>James Calef and his Son Samuel were Captives
among the Indians and French; were taken
at Fort William Henry, in August, 1757. Abigail,
the Wife of James and Mother of Samuel,
made Application in their behalf to the Authorities
of the Province. No Mention is made of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">xxvii</a></span>
their place of Residence. Dr. John Calef, of
Ipswich, married Margaret, Daughter of Nathaniel
and Mary (Leverett) Rogers, of the same
Town. He was born 1725.</p>

<p>After the bloody Fight at Pequawket, Governor
Dummer wrote to Eleazer Tyng: "Send
down to me forthwith by the Bearer hereof, Mr.
Calef, the most intelligent Person among Lovell's
Men returned, that I may have a perfect Account
of that Action." What Mr. Calef this was, does
not with certainty appear.</p>

<p>A Mrs. Mary Calfe died at Concord, N. H.,
August 10, 1817, aged ninety-eight Years. Her
first Husband was Samuel Bradley, who was killed
by the Indians, August 11th, 1746. She afterwards
married Robert Calfe, Esq., of Chester, in
the same State. This is on the Authority of Mr.
Bouton, in his <i>History of Concord</i>, who, in another
Place, says Calfe's Name was Richard. Whether
Richard or Robert, he was probably a Descendant
of James, the only surviving Son of Robert, the
"Merchant of Boston." The maiden Name of
Mrs. Calfe was Folsom.</p>

<p>When the Federal Constitution of New Hampshire
was adopted (1788,) John Calfe, Esq., was
chosen Secretary of the Convention. He was
also Secretary in 1791, when the Constitution was
revised. His Son Joseph died at Hampstead, N.
H., August 6, 1854, aged 79. A John Calef was
in the Old Mill Prison, England, 1789. Jeremiah
Calef, a Native of Exeter, N. H., died at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">xxviii</a></span>
Northfield, 23d February, 1856, aged 73 Years,
10 Months. James, an only Brother of Jeremiah,
died at Sanbornton, 30th March, 1856,
aged 71.</p>

<p>Robert Calef was an eminent Ship-master between
Boston and London before the Revolution.
His Arrival on one Occasion is thus noticed in
the <i>Gazette and News-Letter</i> of April 5th, 1764:
"In Captain Calef came Passengers, the Captains,
Edward Wendell, John Marshall, and Doctor
Marshall of this Town. Mrs. M<sup>c</sup>Taggart, and
her Son Gray of this Town, died of the Smallpox
in London." The Autographs of several of
the Name of Calef (always so spelt) are in the
Writer's Possession from 1755 to 1780. In 1755,
Joseph was engaged in supplying Ships with
Water. In 1767, Joseph Calef, probably the same,
was largely in the leather Trade. He was a Tanner,
and his Tan-yard was in the Neighborhood
of the Old Boston Theatre.</p>

<p>What Time the Family of Robert Calef came
to this Country has not been ascertained. It was
probably in the latter Half of the seventeenth
Century, and our Author may have had his Education
before his Emigration. This View may
be considered probable, from a Passage in his
Preface to the <i>More Wonders</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>After the Above was written, it came to my
Notice, that in a Volume issued by the <i>Mass.
Hist. Soc.</i>, were some Extracts from the <i>Diary</i> of
Cotton Mather. Also the following, concerning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">xxix</a></span>
Robert Calef, in a Memorandum-book of Dr.
Belknap: "Robert Calef, Author of <i>More Wonders
of the Invisible World</i>, was a Native of England;
a young Man of good Sense, and free from
Superstition; a Merchant in Boston. He was
furnished with Materials for his Work by Mr.
Brattle, of Cambridge; and his Brother, of Boston;
and other Gentlemen, who were opposed to
the <i>Salem</i> Proceedings. E. P." [Ebenezer Pemberton?]</p>

And more especially to the Noble <i>Bereans</i><a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> of this <i>Age</i>, wherever
Residing.</p>

<p>Gentlemen,</p>

<p class="dropcap">Y<i>OU that are freed from the Slauery of a corrupt Education;
and that in spite of human Precepts, Examples and Precsidents,
can hearken to the Dictates of Scripture and Reason:</i></p>

<p><i>For your sakes I am content, that these Collections of mine, as also
my Sentiments should be exposed to publick view; In hopes that
having well considered, and compared them with Scripture, you will
see reason, as I do, to question a belief so prevalent</i> (<i>as that here
treated of</i>) <i>as also the practice flowing from thence; they standing
as nearly connext as cause and effect; it being found wholly impracticable,
to extirpate the latter without first curing the former.</i></p>

<p><i>And if the Buffoon or Satyrical will be exercising their Talents,
or if the Bigots wilfully and blindly reject the Testimonies of their
own Reason, and more sure word, it is no more than what I expected
from them.</i></p>

<p><i>But you Gentlemen, I doubt not are willing to Distinguish between
Truth and Error, and if this may be any furtherance to you
herein, I shall not miss my Aim.</i></p>

<p><i>But if you find the contrary, and that my belief herein is any way
Heterodox, I shall be thankful for the Information to any Learned
or Reverend Person, or others, that shall take that pains to inform
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
me better by Scripture, or sound Reason, which is what I have been
long seeking for in this Country</i> in vain.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p><i>In a time when not only</i> England <i>in particular, but almost all</i>
Europe <i>had been labouring against the Usurpations of Tyranny
and Slavery. The</i> English, America <i>has not been behind in a
share in the Common calamities; more especially</i> New-England,
<i>has met not only with such calamities as are common to the rest, but
with several aggravations enhansing such Afflictions, by the Devastations
and Cruelties of the Barbarous</i> Indians <i>in their Eastern
borders, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p><i>But this is not all, they have been harrast (on many accounts) by
a more dreadful Enemy, as will herein appear to the considerate.</i></p>

<p>P. 66. Were it as we are told in <i>Wonders of the Invisible
World</i>, that the Devils were walking about our Streets with
lengthned Chains making a dreadful noise in our Ears, and Brimstone,
even without a Metaphor, was making a horrid and a
hellish stench in our Nostrils.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> P. 49.</p>

<p>And That the Devil exhibiting himself ordinarily as a black-Man,
had decoy'd a fearful knot of Proud, Froward, Ignorant,
Envious and Malitious Creatures, to list themselves in his horrid
Service, by entring their Names in a Book tendered unto them;
and that they have had their Meetings and Sacraments, and associated
themselves to destroy the Kingdom of our Lord Jesus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>Christ, in these parts of the World; having each of them their
Spectres, or Devils Commissionated by them, and [2] representing
of them to be the Engines of their Malice, by these
wicked Spectres, siezing poor People about the Country, with
various and bloody Torments. And of those evidently preternatural
Torments some to have died. And that they have bewitched
some even so far, as to make them self destroyers, and
others in many Towns, here and there languish'd under their evil
hands. The People, thus afflicted, miserably scratch'd and bitten;
and that the same Invisible Furies did stick Pins in them,
and scal'd them, distort and disjoint them, with a Thousand other
Plagues; and sometimes drag them out of their Chambers, and
carry them over Trees, and Hills Miles together, many of them
being tempted to sign the Devils Laws.</p>

<p>P. 7. <i>Those furies whereof several have killed more People perhaps
than would serve to make a Village. If this be the true state of
the Afflictions of this Country, it is very deplorable, and beyond
all other outward Calamities miserable. But if on the other side,
the Matter be as others do understand it, That the Devil has
been too hard for us by his Temptations, signs, and lying Wonders,
with the help of pernicious notions, formerly imbibed and professed;
together with the Accusations of a parcel of possessed, distracted,
or lying Wenches, accusing their Innocent Neighbours,
pretending they see their Spectres</i> (i. e.) <i>Devils in their likeness
Afflicting of them, and that God in righteous Judgement,</i> (<i>after
Men had ascribed his Power to Witches, of commissionating Devils
to do these things</i>) <i>may have given them over to strong delusions to
believe lyes. &amp;c And to let loose the Devils of Envy, Hatred, Pride,
Cruelty and Malice against each other; yet still disguised under the
Mask of Zeal for God, and left them to the branding one another,
with the odious Name of Witch; and upon the Accusation of those</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
<i>above mentioned, Brother to Accuse and Prosecute Brother, Children
their Parents, Pastors and Teachers their immediate Flock unto
death; Shepherds becoming Wolves, Wise Men Infatuated; People
hauled to Prisons, with a bloody noise pursuing to, and insulting
over, the</i> (<i>true</i>) <i>Sufferers at Execution, while some are fleeing from
that called Justice, Justice itself fleeing before such Accusations,
when once it did but begin to refrain further proceedings; and to
question such Practises, some making their Escape out of Prisons,
rather than by an obstinate Defence of their Innocency, to run so
apparent hazard of their Lives; Estates seized, Families of Children
and others left to the Mercy of the Wilderness</i> (<i>not to mention
here the Numbers prescribed, dead in Prisons, or Executed, &amp;c.</i>)</p>

<p><i>All which Tragedies, tho begun in one Town, or rather by one
Parish, has Plague-like spread more than through that Country.
And by its Eccho giving a brand of Infamy to this whole Country,
throughout the World.</i></p>

<p><i>If this were the Miserable case of this Country in the time
thereof, and that the Devil had so far prevailed upon us in our
Sentiments and Actions, as to draw us from so much as looking into
the Scriptures for our guidance in these pretended Intricacies, leading
us to a trusting in blind guides, such as the corrupt practices of
some other Countries or the bloody Experiments of Bodin,</i><a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
[3] <i>and
such other Authors. Then tho our Case be most miserable, yet it
must be said of</i> New-England, <i>Thou hast destroyed thyself, and
brought this greatest of Miseries upon thee.</i></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
<i>And now whether the Witches</i> (<i>such as have made a compact by
Explicit Covenant with the Devil, having thereby obtained a power
to Commissionate him</i>) <i>have been the cause of our miseries.</i></p>

<p><i>Or whether a Zeal governed by blindness and passion, and led by
president, has not herein precipitated us into far greater wickedness</i>
(<i>if not Witchcrafts</i>) <i>than any have been yet proved against those
that suffered.</i></p>

<p><i>To be able to distinguish aright in this matter, to which of these
two to refer our Miseries is the present Work. As to the former,
I know of no sober Man, much less Reverend Christian, that being
ask'd dares affirm and abide by it, that Witches have that power;</i>
viz. <i>to Commissionate Devils to kill and destroy. And as to the
latter, it were well if there were not too much of truth in it, which
remains to be demonstrated.</i></p>

<p><i>But here it will be said, what need of Raking in the Coals that
lay buried in oblivion. We cannot recal those to Life again that
have suffered, supposing it were unjustly; it tends but to the exposing
the Actors, as if they had proceeded irregularly.</i></p>

<p><i>Truly I take this to be just as the Devil would have it, so
much to fear disobliging men, as not to endeavour to detect his Wiles,
that so he may the sooner, and with the greater Advantages set the
same on foot again (either here or elsewhere) so dragging us through
the Pond twice by the same Cat.</i><a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
<i>And if Reports do not</i> (<i>herein</i>)
<i>deceive us, much the same has been acting this present year in</i> Scotland.
<i>And what Kingdom or Country is it, that has not had their
bloody fits and turns at it. And if this is such a catching disease,
and so universal, I presume I need make no Apology for my Endeavours
to prevent, as far as in my power, any more such bloody Victims or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
Sacrifices; tho indeed I had rather any other would have undertaken
so offensive, tho necessary a task; yet all things weighed, I had rather
thus Expose myself to Censure, than that it should be wholly omitted.
Were the notions in question, innocent and harmless, respecting the
glory of God, and well being of Men, I should not have engaged in
them, but finding them in my esteem, so intollerably destructive of both.
This together with my being by Warrant called before the Justices,
in my own Just Vindication, I took it to be a call from God, to my
Power, to Vindicate his Truths against the</i> Pagan <i>and</i> Popish
<i>Assertions, which are so prevalent; for tho Christians in general do
own the Scriptures to be their only Rule of Faith and Doctrine, yet
these Notions will tell us, that the Scriptures have not sufficiently,
nor at all described the crime of Witchcraft, whereby the culpable
might be detected, tho it be positive in the Command to punish it by
Death; hence the World has been from time to time perplext in the
prosecution of the several Diabolical mediums of Heathenish and
Popish Invention, to detect an Imaginary Crime</i> (<i>not but that there
are Witches, such as the Law of God</i> [4] <i>describes</i>)<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
<i>which has
produced a deluge of Blood; hereby rendering the Commands of God
not only void but dangerous.</i></p>

<p><i>So also they own Gods Providence and Government of the World,
and that Tempests and Storms, Afflictions and Diseases are of his
sending; yet these Notions tell us, that the Devil has the power of
all these, and can perform them when commission'd by a Witch
thereto, and that he has a power at the Witches call to act and do,
without and against the course of Nature, and all natural causes,
in afflicting and killing of Innocents; and this is that so many have
died for.</i></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
<i>Also it is generally believed, that if any Man has strength, it is
from God the Almighty Being: but these notions will tell us, that
the Devil can make one Man as strong as many, which was one of
the best proofs, as it was counted, against Mr.</i> Burroughs <i>the
Minister; tho his contemporaries in the Schools during his Minority
could have testified, that his strength was then as much superior to
theirs as ever</i><a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
(<i>setting aside incredible Romances</i>) <i>it was discovered
to be since. Thus rendering the power of God, and his providence
of none Effect.</i></p>

<p><i>These are some of the destructive notions of this Age, and however
the asserters of them seem sometimes to value themselves much upon
sheltring their Neighbors from Spectral Accusations. They may
deserve as much thanks as that Tyrant, that having industriously
obtained an unintelligible charge against his Subjects, in matters
wherein it was impossible they should be Guilty, having thereby their
lives in his power, yet suffers them of his meer Grace to live, and
will be call'd gracious Lord.</i></p>

<p><i>It were too</i> Icarian<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
<i>a task for one unfurnish'd with necessary
learning, and Library, to give any Just account, from whence so
great delusions have sprung, and so long continued. Yet as an
Essay from those scraps of reading that I have had opportunity of;
it will be no great venture to say, that Signs and Lying Wonders
have been one principal cause.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>

<i>It is written of</i> Justin Martyr,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> <i>who lived in the second Century,

<i>Gregory</i>, Fol. 37. Ει Θεοςζσι <i>&amp;c.</i> If God be the creator and
Lord of the World, how comes it to pass that <i>Apollonius</i> his
<i>Telisms</i>, have so much over-ruled the course of things! for we
see that they also have stilled the Waves of the Sea; and the
raging of the Winds, and prevailed against the Noisome Flies,
and Incursions of wild Beasts,] <i>&amp;c. If so Eminent and Early a
Christian were by these false shews in such doubt, it is the less wonder
in our depraved times, to meet with what is Equivalent thereto:
Besides this a certain Author informs me, that</i> [Julian (<i>afterwards
called the Apostate</i>) <i>being instructed in the Philosophy and Disciplines
of the Heathen, by</i> Libarius <i>his Tutor, by this</i> [5] <i>means he came
to love Philosophy better than the Gospel, and so by degrees turn'd
from Christianity to Heathenism.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>

 <i>This same</i> Julian <i>did, when</i> Apostate, <i>forbid that Christians
should be instructed in the Discipline of the</i> Gentiles, <i>which</i> (<i>it
seems</i>) Socrates <i>a Writer of the Ecclesiastical History, does acknowledge
to be by the singular Providence of God; Christians having
then begun to degenerate from the Gospel, and to betake themselves
to Heathenish learning. And in the</i> Mercury <i>for the Month of</i>
February, 1695, <i>there is this Account</i> [That the Christian Doctors
conversing much with the writings of the <i>Heathen</i>, for the
gaining of Eloquence. A Counsel was held at <i>Carthage</i>, which
forbad the reading of the Books of the <i>Gentiles</i>.]</p>

<p><i>From all which it may be easily perceived, that in the Primitive
times of Christianity, when not only many Heathen of the Vulgar; but
also many learned Men and Philosophers had imbraced the Christian
Faith; they still retained a love to their Heathen-learning, to which
as one observes being transplanted into a Christian soils, soon proved
productive of pernicious weeds, which over-ran the face of the
Church, hence it was so deformed as the Reformation found it.</i></p>

<p><i>Among other pernicious Weeds arising from this Root, the Doctrine
of the power of Devils and Witchcraft as it is now, and long
has been understood, is not the least; the Fables of</i> Homer, Virgil,
Horace <i>and</i> Ovid, &amp;c. <i>being for the Elegancy of their Language
retained then</i> (<i>and so are to this day</i>) <i>in the schools; have not
only introduced, but established such Doctrines to the poisoning the
Christian World.</i><a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
<i>A certain Author expresses it thus</i> [<i>that as
the Christian Schools at first brought Men from Heathenism to the
Gospel, so these Schools carry Men from the Gospel to Heathenism,
as to their great perfection</i>] <i>and Mr.</i> I. M. <i>in his</i> Remarkable
Providences, <i>gives an account that (as he calls it) an old Counsel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
did Anathematize all those that believed such power of the Devils,
accounting it a Damnable Doctrine.</i><a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
<i>But as other Evils did
afterwards increase in the Church</i> (<i>partly by such Education</i>) <i>so
this insensibly grew up with them, tho not to that degree, as that any
Counsel I have ever heard or Read of has to this day taken off
those</i> Anathema's; <i>yet after this the Church so far declined, that
Witchcraft became a Principal, Ecclesiastical Engine</i> (<i>as also that
of Heresy was</i>) <i>to root up all that stood in their way; and besides
the ways of Tryal, that we have still in practice, they invented some,
which were peculiar to themselves; which whenever they were
minded to improve against any Orthodox believer, they could easily
make Effectual: That Deluge of Blood which that</i> Scarlet Whore
<i>has to answer for, shed under this notion, how amazing is it.</i></p>

<p><i>The first in</i> England <i>that I have read of, of any note since the
Reformation, that asserts this Doctrine, is the famous Mr.</i> Perkins,
<i>he</i> (<i>as also Mr.</i> Gaul, <i>and Mr.</i> Bernard, <i>&amp;c.</i>) <i>seems all of them to
have undertaken one Task. They taking notice of the Multiplicity
of irregular ways to try them by, invented by Heathen and Papists,
made it their business and main work herein to oppose such as they
saw to be pernicious. And if they did not look more narrowly into it,
but followed the first,</i> viz. <i>Mr.</i> Perkins <i>whose Education</i> (<i>as theirs
also</i>) <i>had forestall'd him into such belief, whom they readily followed,
it cannot be wondered at: And that they were men liable to
Err, and so not to be trusted to as perfect guides, will manifestly
appear to him that shall see their several receits laid down to detect
them by their Presumptive and Positive ones. And consider how few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>of either have any foundation in Scripture or Reason; and how
vastly they differ from each other in both, each having his Art by
himself, which Forty or an Hundred more may as well imitate, and
give theirs,</i> ad infinitum, <i>being without all manner of proof.</i> [6]
<i>But tho this be their main design to take off People from those Evil
and bloody ways of trial which they speak so much against. Yet
this does not hinder to this day, but the same evil ways or as bad are
still used to detect them by, and that even among Protestants; and
is so far justified, that a Reverend Person has said lately here, how
else shall we detect Witches?</i><a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
<i>And another being urged to prove
by Scripture such a sort of Witch as has power to send Devils to
kill men, replied that he did as firmly believe it as any article of his
Faith. And that he</i> (<i>the Inquirer</i>) <i>did not go to the Scripture; to
learn the Mysteries of his trade or Art. What can be said more to
Establish there Heathenish notions and to villifie the Scriptures, our
only Rule; and that after we have seen such dire effects thereof, as
has threatned the utter Extirpation of this whole Country.</i></p>

<p><i>And as to most of the Actors in these Tragedies, tho they are so
far from defending their Actions that they will readily own, that
undue steps have been taken, &amp;c. yet it seems they choose that the
same should be Acted over again, inforced by their Example, rather
than that it should Remain as a Warning to Posterity, as herein
they have mist it. So far are they from giving Glory to God, and
taking the due shame to themselves.</i></p>

<p><i>And now to sum up all in a few words, we have seen a Biggotted
Zeal, stirring up a Blind, and most Bloody rage, not against
Enemies, or Irreligious proffligate Persons. But (in Judgment of
Charity, and to view) against as Vertuous and Religious as any they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>have left behind them in this Country, which have suffered as Evil
doers</i> (<i>with the utmost extent of rigour, not that so high a Character
is due to all that Suffered</i>) <i>and this by the Testimony of Vile
Varlets as not only were known before, but have been further apparent
since by their Manifest Lives, whordoms, incest, &amp;c. The
accusations of these, from their Spectral Sight, being the chief Evidence
against those that Suffered. In which Accusations they were
upheld by both Magistrates and Ministers, so long as they Apprehended
themselves in no Danger.</i><a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p><i>And then tho they could defend neither the Doctrine, nor the
Practice, yet none of them have in such a publick manner as the
case Requires, testified against either; tho at the same time they
could not but be sensible what a Stain and lasting Infamy they have
brought upon the whole Country, to the indangering the future
welfair not only of this but of other places, induced by their Example;
if not, to an intailing the Guilt of all the Righteous Blood
that has been by the same means Shed, by Heathen or Papists, &amp;c.
upon themselves, whose deeds they have so far justified, occasioning
the great Dishonour and Blasphemy of the Name of God, Scandalizing
the Heathen, hardning of Enemies; and as a Natural effect
thereof, to the great Increase of Atheism.</i></p>

<p><i>I shall conclude only with acquainting the Reader, that of these
Collections, the first containing more Wonders of the Invisible
World, I received of a Gentleman, who had it of the Author, and
communicated it to use, with his express consent, of which this is a
true Copy.</i><a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
<i>As to the letters, they are for Substance the same I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>sent, tho with some small Variation or Addition. Touching the
two Letters from a Gentleman at his request, I have forborn
naming him. It is great Pity the matters of Fast, and indeed the
whole, had not been done by some abler hana better Accomplished
and Advantages with both natural and acquired Judgments, but
others not Appearing, I have inforc'd myself to do what is done,

that the Title of Dr. I. Mather's
Work is <i>An Essay for the Recording

was printed in a 12mo. 1684. This
Work was elegantly reprinted in a
Crown 12mo or a 16mo. by John

Brother of Boston; and other Gentlemen,
who were opposed to the

is signed E. P.; but the Editor of
the Article referred to makes no
Conjecture as for whom the Initials

Pemberton, though that Gentleman
was comparatively a young
Man in 1697; old enough, however,
to have been interested in
these Affairs.</p></div></div>

<span class="pagenum hidev"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
</p>

<p class="dropcap">WIthin these few years there died in the
<i>Southern Parts</i> a Christian <i>Indian</i>, who
notwithstanding some of his <i>Indian</i> Weakness,
had something of a better Character of vertue
and Goodness, than many of our People can allow
to most of their Country-men, that profess the
<i>Christian Religion</i>.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> He had been a Zealous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>Preacher of the Gospel to his Neighbourhood,
and a sort of <i>Overseer</i>, or <i>Officer</i>, to whose Conduct
was owing very much of what good order
was maintained among those Proselited <i>Savages</i>.
This Man returning home from the Funeral of
his Son, was complemented by an <i>Englishman</i>,
expressing <i>Sorrow for his Loss</i>; now, tho' the
<i>Indians</i> use upon the Death of Relations, to be
the most Passionate and Outragious Creatures in
the World, yet this Converted <i>Indian</i> Handsomly
and Chearfully replid, <i>Truly I am sorry, and I am
not sorry; I am sorry that I have Buried a dear
Son; but I am not sorry that the will of God is
done. I know that without the will of God my son
could not have died, and I know that the will</i> [2] <i>of
God is always just and good, and so I am satisfied.</i>
Immediately upon this, even within a few hours,
he fell himself Sick of a Disease that quickly
kill'd him; in the time of which Disease he
called his Folks about him, earnestly perswading
them to be Sincere in their <i>Praying unto God</i>, and
beware of the <i>Drunkenness</i>, the <i>Idleness</i>, the <i>Lying</i>,
whereby so many of that Nation disgrac'd their
Profession of Christianity; adding, that he was
ashamed, when he thought how little Service he
had hitherto done for God; and that if God
would prolong his Life he would Labour to do
better Service, but that he was fully sure he was
now going to the Lord <i>Jesus Christ</i>, who had
bought him with his own Precious <i>Blood</i>; and for
his part, he long'd to Die that he might be with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
Glorious Lord; and in the mid'st of such passages
he gave up the Ghost, but in such repute, that
the <i>English</i> People of good Fashion did not think
much of Travelling a great way to his <i>Interment</i>.
Lest my Reader do now wonder why I have related
this piece of a Story, I will now hasten to
abate that Wonder, by telling that whereto this
was intended, but for an <i>Introduction</i>: know then,
that this remarkable <i>Indian</i> being a little before
he Died at work in the Wood making of Tarr,
there appeared unto him a <i>Black Man</i>, of a Terrible
aspect, and more than humane Dimensions,
threatning <span class="errauthor" title="read: bitterly">bittterly</span> to kill him if he would not
promise to leave off <i>Preaching</i> as he did to his
Countrey-Men, and promise particularly, <i>that if
he preached any more, he would say nothing of Jesus
Christ unto them?</i> The <i>Indian</i> amaz'd, yet had
the courage to answer, <i>I will in spite of you go on
to preach</i> Christ <i>more than ever I did, and the God
whom I serve will keep me that you shall never hurt
me.</i> Hereupon the Apparition abating somewhat
of his fierceness, offered to the <i>Indian</i> a <i>Book</i> of a
considerable thickness and a <i>Pen and Ink</i>, and
said, that if he would now set his hand unto that
<i>Book</i>, he would require nothing further of him;
but the Man refused the motion with indignation,
and fell down upon his knees into a Fervent and
Pious Prayer unto God, for help against the
<i>Tempter</i>, whereupon the <i>Demon</i> Vanish't.</p>

<p>This is a Story which I would never have tendered
unto my Reader, if I had not Receiv'd it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
from an honest and useful <i>English Man</i>,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> who is
at this time a Preacher of the Gospel to the <i>Indians</i>;
nor would the probable Truth of it have
encouraged me to have tendered it, if this also
had not been a fit introduction unto yet a further
Narrative.</p>

<p><i>Sect.</i> 2. 'Twas not much above a year or two,
after this Accident (of which no manner of Noise
has been made) that there was a Prodigious descent
of <i>Devils</i> upon divers places near the Centre
of this Province; wherein some scores of <i>Miserable
People</i> were Troubled by horrible appearances
of a <i>Black-Man</i>, accompanied with <i>Spectres</i>,
wearing these and those Humane Shapes, who offer'd
them a <i>Book</i> to be by them sign'd, in token
of their being Listed for the Service of the <i>Devil</i>,
and upon their [3] denying to do it, they were
<i>dragoon'd</i> with a thousand Preternatural Torments,
which gave no little terror to the beholders of
these unhappy <i>Energuments</i>. There was one in
the <i>North</i> part of <i>Boston</i> seized by the <i>Evil Angels</i>
many Months after the General Storm of the
late <i>Inchantments</i> was over, and when the Countrey
had long lain pretty quiet, both as to Molestations
and Accusations from the INVISIBLE
WORLD, her Name was <i>Margaret Rule</i>, a
Young Woman, She was born of sober and honest
Parents, yet Living, but what her own Character
was before her Visitation, I can speak with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>less confidence of exactness, because I observe that
wherever the <i>Devils</i> have been let loose to worry
any Poor Creature amongst us, a great part of
the Neighbourhood presently set themselves to inquire
and relate all the little Vanities of their
Childhood, with such unequal exaggerations, as
to make them appear greater Sinners than any
whom the Pilate of <i>Hell</i> has not yet Preyed
upon: But it is affirm'd, that for about half a
year before her Visitation, she was observably improved
in the hopeful symptoms of a new Creature;
She was become furiously concern'd for the
everlasting <i>Salvation</i> of her Soul, and careful to
avoid the snares of <i>Evil Company</i>. This Young
Woman had never seen the affliction of <i>Mercy
Short</i>,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> whereof a Narrative has been already
given, and yet about half a year after the glorious
and signal deliverance of that poor Damsel, this
<i>Margaret</i> fell into an affliction, marvellous, resembling
hers in almost all the circumstances of
it, indeed the Afflictions were so much alike, that
the relation I have given of the one, would almost
serve as the full History of the other, this was to
that, <i>little more than the second part to the same
Tune</i>; indeed <i>Margarets</i> case was in several points
less remarkable than <i>Mercies</i>, and in some other
things the Entertainment did a little vary.</p>

<p><i>Sect.</i> 3. 'twas upon the <i>Lords Day</i> the 10th of
<i>September</i>, in the Year 1693. that <i>Margaret Rule</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>after some hours of previous disturbance in the
Publick Assembly, fell into odd <i>Fits</i>, which caused
her Friends to carry her home, where her <i>Fits</i>
in a few hours grew into a Figure that satisfied
the Spectators of their being preternatural; some
of the Neighbours were forward enough to suspect
the rise of this Mischief in an House hard-by,
where lived a Miserable Woman, who had
been formerly Imprisoned on the suspicion of
<i>Witchcraft</i>, and who had frequently Cured very
painfull Hurts by muttering over them certain
<i>Charms</i>, which I shall not indanger the Poysoning
of my Reader by repeating. This Woman had
the Evening before <i>Margaret</i> fell into her Calamities,
very bitterly treated her, and threatn'd
her; but the hazard of hurting a poor Woman
that might be innocent, notwithstanding <i>Surmizes</i>
that might have been more strongly grounded
than those, caus'd the pious People in the Vicinity
to try rather whether incessant <i>Supplication</i> to
God [4] <i>alone</i>, might not procure a quicker and
safer Ease to the <i>Afflicted</i>, than hasty Prosecution
of any suppos'd Criminal, and accordingly that
<i>unexceptionable course</i> was all that was ever followed;
yea, which I look'd on as a token for
good, the Afflicted Family was as averse as any
of us all to entertain thoughts of any other
course.</p>

<p><i>Sect.</i> 4. The Young Woman was assaulted by
Eight cruel <i>spectres</i>, whereof she imagin'd that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>she knew <i>three</i> or <i>four</i>, but the rest came still
with their <i>Faces cover'd</i>, so that she could never
have a distinguishing view of the countenance of
those whom she thought she knew; she was very
careful of my reitterated charges <i>to forbear blazing
the names</i>, lest any good Person should come to
suffer any blast of Reputation thro' the cunning
Malice of the great Accuser; nevertheless having
since privately named <i>them</i> to myself, I will venture
to say <i>this</i> of them, that they are a sort of
<i>Wretches</i>, who for these many years have gone
under as Violent <i>Presumptions</i> of <i>Witchcraft</i>, as
perhaps any creatures yet living upon earth; altho'
I am farr from thinking that the Visions
of this Young Woman were Evidence enough
to prove them so. These cursed <i>Spectres</i> now
brought unto her a <i>Book</i> about a <i>Cubet</i> long, a
<i>Book Red</i> and <i>thick</i>, but not very broad, and they
demanded of her that she would set <i>her Hand</i> to
that <i>Book</i>, or touch it at least with her <i>Hand</i>, as
a Sign of her becoming a Servant of the <i>Devil</i>,
upon her peremptory refusal <i>to do</i> what they
asked, they did not after renew the profers of the
<i>Book</i> unto her, but instead thereof, they fell to
Tormenting of her in a manner too Hellish to
be sufficiently described, in those Torments confining
her to her <i>Bed</i>, for just <i>Six weeks</i> together.</p>

<p><i>Sect.</i> 5. Sometimes, but not always together
with the <i>Spectres</i>, there looke't in upon the Young
Woman (according to her account) <i>a short and a
Black Man</i>, whom they call'd their Master&mdash;a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>Wight exactly of the same Dimensions and
Complexion and voice, with the <i>Divel</i> that has
exhibited himself unto other infested People, not
only in other parts of this Country but also in
other Countrys, even of the <i>European World</i>, as
the relation of the Enchantments there inform
us, they all profest themselves Vassals of this
<i>Devil</i>, and in obedience unto him they address
themselves unto various ways of Torturing her;
accordingly she was cruelly <i>pinch'd with Invisible
hands</i>, very often in a Day, and the black and
blew marks of the pinches became immediately
visible unto the standers by. Besides this, when
her attendants had left her without so much as
one pin about her, that so they might prevent
some fear'd inconveniencies; yet she would ever
now and then be miserably hurt with Pins which
were found stuck into her Neck, Back and Arms,
however the Wounds made by the Pins would in
a few minutes ordinarily be cured; she would
also be strangely distorted in her Joynts, and
thrown into such exorbitant <i>Convulsions</i> as [5]
were astonishing unto the Spectators in General;
They that could behold the doleful condition of
the poor Family without sensible compassions,
might have Intrals indeed, but I am sure they
could have no true <i>Bowels</i> in them.</p>

<p><i>Sect.</i> 6. It were a most Unchristian and uncivil,
yea a most unreasonable thing to imagine that
the Fitt's of the Young Woman were but meer
<i>Impostures</i>: And I believe scarce any, but People
of a particular <i>Dirtiness</i>, will harbour such an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
Uncharitable Censure,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> however, because I know
not how far the <i>Devil</i> may drive the Imagination
of poor Creatures when he has possession of them,
that at another time when they are <i>themselves</i>
would scorn to <i>Dissemble</i> any thing. I shall now
confine my Narrative unto passages, wherein there
could be no room left for any Dissimulation. Of
these the first that I'll mention shall be this;
From the time that <i>Margaret Rule</i> first found
herself to be formally besieged by the <i>Spectres</i>
untill the Ninth Day following, namely from
the Tenth of <i>September</i> to the Eighteenth, she
kept an entire Fast, and yet she was unto all appearance
as Fresh, as Lively, as Hearty, at the Nine
Days End, as before they began; in all this time,
tho' she had a very eager <i>Hunger</i> upon her Stomach,
yet if any refreshment were brought unto
her, her Teeth would be set, and she would be
thrown into many Miseries, Indeed <i>once or twice
or so</i> in all this time, her Tormentors permitted
her to swallow a Mouthful of somewhat that
might increase her Miseries, whereof a Spoonful
of <i>Rum</i> was the most considerable; but otherwise,
as I said, her <i>Fast</i> unto the <i>Ninth day</i> was
very extream and rigid: However, afterwards
there scarce passed a day wherein she had not
liberty to take something or other for her <i>Susttentation</i>,
And I must add this further, that this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>business of her <i>Fast</i> was carried so, that it was
impossible to be dissembled without a <i>Combination</i>
of Multitudes of People unacquainted with one
another to support the <i>Juggle</i>, but he that can
imagine such a thing of a Neighbourhood, so
fill'd with Vertuous People is a <i>base man</i>, I cannot
call him any other.</p>

<p><i>Sect.</i> 7. But if the Sufferings of this Young
Woman were not <i>Imposture</i>, yet might they not
be pure Distemper? I will not here inquire
of our <i>Saducees</i> what sort of Distemper 'tis shall
stick the Body full of <i>Pins</i>, without any Hand
that could be seen to stick them; or whether all
the <i>Pin-makers</i> in the World would be willing
to be Evaporated into certain ill habits of Body
producing a <i>Distemper</i>, but of the <i>Distemper</i> my
Reader shall be Judge when I have told him
something further of those unusual Sufferings. I
do believe that the <i>Evil Angels</i> do often take
Advantage from <i>Natural Distempers</i> in the Children
of Men to annoy them with such further
Mischiefs as we call <i>preternatural</i>. The Malignant
<i>Vapours</i> and <i>Humours</i> of our Diseased Bodies
may be used by <i>Devils</i> thereinto insinu[6]ating as
engine of the Execution of their Malice upon
those Bodies; and perhaps for this reason one
Sex may suffer more Troubles of some kinds
from the <i>Invisible World</i> than the <i>other</i>, as well as
for <i>that reason</i> for which the Old <i>Serpent</i> made
where he did his <i>first <span class="errauthor" title="read: Address">Adddress</span></i>. But I Pray
what will you say to this, <i>Margaret Rule</i> would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
sometimes have her Jaws forcibly pulled open;
whereupon something <i>Invisible</i> would be poured
down her throat; we all saw her swallow, and
yet we saw her try all she could by Spitting,
Coughing and Shriking, that she might not
swalow, but one time the standers by plainly saw
something of that odd <i>Liquor</i> itself on the outside
of her <i>Neck</i>; She cried out of it as of <i>Scalding
Brimstone</i> poured into her, and the whole House
would Immediately scent so hot of <i>Brimstone</i> that
we were scarce able to endure it, whereof there
are scores of Witnesses; but the Young Woman
herself would be so monstrously <i>Inflam'd</i> that it
would have broke a Heart of Stone to have seen
her Agonies, <i>this</i> was a thing that several times
happen'd and several times when her Mouth was
thus pull'd open, the standers by clapping their
Hands close thereupon the distresses that otherwise
followed would be diverted. Moreover there
was a <i>whitish powder</i> to us <i>Invisible</i> somtimes cast
upon the <i>Eyes</i> of this Young Woman, whereby
her <i>Eyes</i> would be extreamly incommoded, but
one time some of this <i>Powder</i> was fallen actually
<i>Visible</i> upon her Cheek, from whence the People
in the Room wiped it with their Handkerchiefs,
and somtimes the Young Woman would also be
so bitterly scorched with the unseen Sulphur
thrown upon her, that very sensible <i>Blisters</i> would
be raised upon her Skin, whereto her Friends
found it necessary to apply the <i>Oyl's</i> proper for
common <i>Burning</i>, but the most of these Hurts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
would be cured in two or three days at farthest:
I think I may <i>without Vanity</i> pretend to have
read not a few of the best System's of <i>Physick</i><a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
that have been yet seen in these <i>American</i> Regions,
but I must confess that I have never yet learned
the Name of the Natural Distemper, whereto
these odd symptoms do belong: However I might
suggest perhaps many a <i>Natural Medicine</i>, which
would be of singular use against many of them.</p>

<p><i>Sect.</i> 8. But there fell out some <i>other matters</i>
far beyond the reach of <i>Natural Distemper</i>: This
<i>Margaret Rule</i> once in the middle of the Night
Lamented sadly that the <i>Spectres</i> threat'ned the
Drowning of a Young Man in the Neighbourhood,
whom she named unto the Company: well
it was afterwards found that at that very time this
Young Man, having been prest on Board <i>a Man
of War</i> then in the Harbour, was out of some
dissatisfaction attempting to swim ashoar, and he
had been <i>Drowned</i> in the attempt, if a Boat had
not seasonably taken him up; it was by computation
a minute or two after the Young Womans
discourse of the <i>Drowning</i>, that the Young Man
took the Water; At another time she told us
that [7] the <i>Spectres</i> bragg'd and laughed in her
hearing about an exploit they had lately done, by
stealing from a Gentleman his <i>Will</i> soon after he
had written it; and within a few hours after she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>had spoken this there came to me a Gentleman
with a private complaint, that having written his
<i>Will</i>, it was unaccountably gone out of the way,
<i>how</i> or <i>where</i> he could not Imagine; and besides
all this, there were wonderful <i>Noises</i> every now
and then made about the Room, which our People
could Ascribe to no other Authors but the
<i>Spectres</i>, yea, the Watchers affirm that they heard
those fiends clapping of their hands together with
an <i>Audibleness</i>, wherein they could not be Imposed
upon: And once her Tormentors pull'd
her up to the <i>Cieling</i> of the Chamber, and held
her there before a very Numerous Company of
<i>Spectators</i>, who found it as much as they could
<i>all do</i> to pull her down again.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> There was also
another very surprising circumstance about her,
agreeable to what we have not only <i>read</i> in several
Histories concerning the <i>Imps</i> that have been
Imployed in <i>Witchcraft</i>; but also known in some
of our own afflicted: <i>We once thought we perceived
something stir upon her pillow at a little distance
from her, whereupon one present laying his
hand there, he to his horror</i> apprehended that <i>he
felt,</i> tho' none could see it, <i>a living Creature,</i> not
<i>altogether unlike a Rat, which nimbly escap'd from
him:</i> and there were diverse other Persons who
were thrown into a great consternation by feeling,
as they Judg'd, at other times the same <i>Invisible
Animal</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
<i>Sect.</i> 9. As it has been with a Thousand other
<i>Inchanted</i> People, so it was with <i>Margaret Rule</i>
in this particular, that there were several words
which her <i>Tormentors</i> would not let her hear,
especially the words Pray or Prayer, and yet she
could so hear the letters of those words distinctly
mentioned as to know what they ment. The
standers by were forced sometimes thus in discourse
to spell a word to her, but because there
were some so ridiculous as to count it a sort of
<i>Spell</i> or a <i>Charm</i> for any thus to accommodate
themselves to the capacity of the Sufferer, little
of this kind was done. But that which was more
singular in this matter, was that she could not use
these <i>words</i> in those penetrating discourses, wherewith
she would sometimes address the <i>Spectres</i>
that were about her. She would sometimes for
a long while together apply herself to the <i>Spectres</i>,
whom she supposed the <i>Witches</i>, with such
<i>Exortations to Repentance</i> as would have melted
an Heart of <i>Adamant</i> to have heard them; her
strains of Expression and Argument were truly
Extraordinary; A person perhaps of the best
Education and Experience and of <i>Attainments</i>
much beyond hers could not have exceeded them:
nevertheless when she came to these Words <i>God</i>,
<i>Lord</i>, <i>Christ</i>, <i>Good</i>, <i>Repent</i>, and some other such,
her Mouth could not utter them, whereupon she
would sometimes in an Angry <i>Parenthesis</i> complain
of their Wickedness in stopping that <i>Word</i>,
but she would then go [8] on with some other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
<i>Terms</i> that would serve to tell what she ment.
And I believe that if the most suspicious Person
in the world had beheld all the Circumstances of
this matter, he would have said it could not have
been dissembled.</p>

<p><i>Sect.</i> 10. Not only in the <i>Swedish</i>, but also in
the <i>Salem</i> Witchcraft the Inchanted People have
talked much of a <i>White Spirit</i> from whence they
received marvellous Assistances in their Miseries;
what lately befel <i>Mercy Short</i><a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> from the Communications
of such a <i>Spirit</i>, hath been the just
Wonder of us all, but by such a <i>Spirit</i> was <i>Margaret
Rule</i> now also visited. She says that she
could never see his <i>Face</i>; but that she had a frequent
view of his bright, Shining and glorious
Garments; he stood by her <i>Bed-side</i> continually
heartning and comforting of her and counselling
her to maintain her Faith and hope in God, and
never comply with the temptations of her Adversaries;
she says he told her, that <i>God had permitted
her afflictions to befall her for the everlasting and
unspeakable good of her own soul, and for the good
of many others, and for his own Immortal Glory,
and that she should therefore be of good Chear, and
be assured of a speedy deliverance</i>; and the wonderful
resolution of mind wherewith she encountered
her Afflictions were but agreeable to such
expectations. Moreover a Minister having one
Day with some Importunity Prayed for the deliverance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
of this Young Woman, and pleaded
that she belong'd to his Flock and charge; he
had so far a right unto her as that he was to do
the part of a Minister of our Lord for the
bringing of her home unto God; only now the
<i>Devil</i> hindred him in <i>doing</i> that which he had a
<i>right</i> thus to do, and whereas He had a <i>better
Title</i> unto her to bring her home to <i>God</i> than the
<i>Divel</i> could have unto her to carry her away
from the <i>Lord</i>, <i>he</i> therefore humbly applied himself
unto <i>God</i>, who alone could right this matter,
with a suit that she might be rescued out of
<i>Satans Hands</i>; Immediately upon this, tho' she
heard nothing of this transaction she began to
call that Minister her <i>Father</i>, and that was the
Name whereby she every day before all sorts of
People distinguished him: the occasion of it she
says was <i>this</i>, the <i>white Spirit</i> presently upon this
transaction did after this manner speak to her,
<i>Margaret, you now are to take notice that</i> (such a
Man) <i>is your Father, God has given you to him, do
you from this time look upon him as your Father,
obey him, regard him as your Father, follow his
Counsels and you shall do well</i>; And tho' there was
one passage more, which I do as little know what
to make of as any of the rest, I am now going
to relate it; more than three times have I seen it
fulfilled in the Deliverance of Inchanted and
Possest Persons, whom the Providence of God
has cast into my way, that their Deliverance
could not be obtained before the <i>third Fast</i> kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
for them, and the third day still obtain'd the
Deliverance, altho' I have thought of <i>beseeching
of the Lord thrice, when buffered by Sa</i>[9]<i>tan</i>, yet
I must earnestly Intreat all my Readers to beware
of any superstitious conceits upon the Number
<i>Three</i>, if our God will hear us upon once Praying
and Fasting before him 'tis well, and if he will
not vouchsafe his <i>Mercy</i> upon our <i>thrice</i> doing so,
yet we must not be so discouraged as to throw by
our Devotion but if the Soveraign <i>Grace</i> of our
God will in any particular Instances count our
Patience enough tryed when we have Solemnly
waited upon him for any determinate Number of
times, who shall say to him, what doest thou, and
if there shall be any Number of Instances, wherein
this Grace of our God has exactly holden the
same course, it may have a room in our humble
<i>Observations</i>, I hope, without any Superstition;
I say then that after <i>Margaret Rule</i> had been
more than five weeks in her Miseries, this <i>White
Spirit</i> said unto her, <i>Well this day such a Man</i>
(whom he named) <i>has kept a third day for your
deliverance, now be of good cheer you shall speedily
be delivered</i>. I inquired whether what had been
said of that Man were true, and I gained exact
and certain information that it was precisely so,
but I doubt lest in relating this Passage that I
have used more openness than a Friend should be
treated with, and for that cause I have concealed
several of the most <i>memorable things</i> that have
occurred not only in this but in some former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
Histories, altho indeed I am not so well satisfied
about the true nature of this <i>white Spirit</i>, as to
count that I can do a Friend much Honour by
reporting what notice this <i>white Spirit</i> may have
thus taken of him.</p>

<p><i>Sect.</i> 11. On the last day of the Week her
Tormentors as she thought and said, approaching
towards her, would be forced still to recoil and
retire as unaccountably unable to meddle with
her, and they would retire to the Fire side with
their Poppets; but going to stick Pins into those
Poppets, they could not (according to their visions)
make the Pins to enter, she insulted over them
with a very Proper derision, daring them now to
do their worst, whilst she had the satisfaction to
see their <i>Black Master</i> strike them and kick them,
like an <i>Overseer</i> of so many <i>Negro's</i>, to make
them to do their work, and renew the marks of
his vengeance on them, when they failed of doing
of it.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> At last being as it were tired with their
ineffectual Attempts to mortifie her they furiously
said, <i>Well you shant be the last</i>. And after a pause
they added, <i>Go, and the Devil go with you, we can
do no more</i>; whereupon they flew out of the Room,
and she returning perfectly to herself most affectionately
gave thanks to God for her deliverance;
her Tormentors left her extream <i>weak and faint</i>,
and overwhelmed with <i>Vapours</i>, which would
not only cause her sometimes to Swoon away, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>also now and then for a little while discompose
the reasonableness of her Thoughts; Nevertheless
her former troubles returned not, but we are
now waiting to see the good effects of those
troubles upon the Souls of all concern'd, And
now I suppose that some of our Learned <i>wit[10]lings</i>
of the <i>Coffee-House</i>, for fear lest these proofs
of an <i>Invisible-world</i> should spoil some of their
sport, will endeavour to turn them all into sport,
for which <i>Buffoonary</i> their only pretence will be,
<i>they cant understand how such things as these could
be done</i> whereas indeed he that is but Philosopher
enough to have read but one <i>Little Treatise</i>, Published
in the Year 1656, by no other Man than
the Chyrurgion of an <i>Army</i>, or but one Chap.
of <i>Helmont</i>,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> which I will not quote at this time
too particularly, may give a far more intelligible
account of these <i>Appearances</i> than most of these
<i>Blades</i> can give <i>why</i> and how their <i>Tobacco</i> makes
'em Spit; or which way the flame of their Candle
becomes illuminating, as for that <i>cavil, the
world would be undone if the Devils could have such
power as they seem to have in several of our stories</i>,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
it may be Answered that as to many things
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>the <i>Lying Devils</i> have only known them to be
done, and then pretended unto the doing of those
things, but the true and best Answer is, that by
these things we only see what the <i>Devils</i> could
have <i>powers</i> to do, if the great God should give
them those powers, whereas now our Histories
affords a <i>Glorious Evidence for the being of a God</i>,
the World would indeed be <i>undone</i>, and horribly
<i>undone</i>, if these Devils, who now and then get
liberty to play some very mischievous pranks,
were not under a daily restraint of some <i>Almighty
Superior</i> from doing more of such Mischiefs.
Wherefore instead of all Apish <i>flouts</i> and <i>jeers</i> at
Histories, which have such undoubted confirmation,
as that no Man that has breeding enough
to regard the Common Laws of <i>Humane Society</i>,
will offer to doubt of 'em, it becomes us rather
to adore the goodness of God, who does not
permit such things every day to befall us <i>all</i>, as
he sometimes did permit to befall some few of
our miserable Neighbours.</p>

<p><i>Sect.</i> 12. And what after all my unwearied
Cares and Pains, to rescue the <i>Miserable</i> from the
Lions and Bears of <i>Hell</i>, which had siezed them,
and after all my Studies to disappoint the Devils
in their designs to confound my Neighbourhood,
must I be driven to the necessity of an <i>Apology</i>?
Truly the hard <i>representations</i> wherewith <i>some Ill
Men have reviled my conduct</i>, and the Countenance
which other Men have given to these representations,
oblige me to give Mankind some account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
of my Behaviour; No Christian can, I say none
but evil workers can criminate my visiting such
of my poor flock as have at any time fallen under
the terrible and sensible molestations of <i>Evil Angels</i>;
let their Afflictions have been what they
will, I could not have answered it unto my
Glorious <i>Lord</i>, if I had withheld my just <i>Counsels</i>
and <i>Comforts</i> from them; and if I have also
with some exactness observ'd the methods of the
<i>Invisible World</i>, when they have thus become
observable, I have been but a Servant of Mankind
in doing so; yea no less a Person than the <i>Venerable
Baxter</i>, has more than once or twice in the
most Publick manner invited Mankind to thank
[11] me for that <i>Service</i>. I have not been insensible
of a greater danger attending me in this
fulfilment of my Ministry, than if I had been to
take Ten Thousand steps over a Rocky Mountain
fill'd with <i>Rattle-Snakes</i>; but I have consider'd,
he that is wise will observe things, and the <i>Surprising
Explication</i> and confirmation of the <i>biggest
part</i> of the <i>Bible</i>, which I <i>have seen</i> given in
these things, has <i>abundantly paid me</i> for observing
them. Now in my visiting of the Miserable, I
was always of this opinion, that we were Ignorant
of what <i>Powers</i> the <i>Devils</i> might have to
do their mischiefs in the shapes of some that had
never been explicitly engaged in <i>Diabolical Confederacies</i>,
and that therefore tho' many <i>Witchcrafts</i>
had been fairly detected <i>on Enquiries</i> provoked
and begun by <i>Specteral Exhibitions</i>, yet we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
could not easily be too jealous of the <i>Snares</i> laid
for us in the <i>devices of Satan</i>; the World knows
how many <i>Pages</i> I have Composed and Published,
and particular gentlement in the Government
know how many <i>Letters</i> I have written to prevent
the excessive Credit of <i>Specteral Accusations</i>,
wherefore I have still charged the <i>Afflicted</i> that
they should <i>Cry</i> out of no body for Afflicting of
'em. But that if this might be any Advantage
they might <i>privately</i> tell their minds to some one
Person of <i>discretion</i> enough to make no <i>ill use</i> of
their communications, accordingly there has been
this effect of it, that the Name of <i>No one</i> good
Person in the World ever came under any blemish
by means of any <i>Afflicted</i>, Person that fell under
<i>my</i> particular cognizance, yea no one Man, Woman
or Child ever came into any troube for the sake of
any that were <i>Afflicted</i> after I <i>had once begun</i> to
look after 'em; how often have I had this thrown
into my dish, that many years ago I had an opportunity
to have brought forth such People as have
in the late storm of <i>Witchcraft</i> been complain'd
of, but that I smother'd all, and after that storm
was rais'd at <i>Salem</i>, I did myself offer to provide
Meat, Drink and Lodging for no less than Six of
the Afflicted, that so an Experiment might be
made, whether <i>Prayer</i> with <i>Fasting</i> upon the
removal of the distressed might not put a Period
to the trouble then rising, without giving the <i>Civil
Authority</i> the trouble of prosecuting those things
which nothing but a Conscientious regard unto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
the cries of Miserable Families, could have overcome
the Reluctancies of the Honourable Judges
to meddle with;<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> In short I do humbly but freely
affirm it, there is not that Man living in this
World who has been more desirous than the poor
Man I <i>to shelter</i> my Neighbours from the Inconveniences
of <i>Specteral Outcries</i>, yea I am very
jealous I have done so much <i>that way as to Sin</i>
in what I have done, such have been the Cowardize
and Fearfulness whereunto my regard unto
the dissatisfactions of other People has precipitated
me. I know a Man in the World, who
has thought he has been able to Convict some
such <i>Witches</i> as ought to Dye, but his respect unto
the Publick <i>Peace</i> has caused him rather to try
whether <i>He</i> [12] <i>could not renew them by repentance</i>:
and as I have been Studious to defeat the
<i>Devils</i> of their expectations to set people together
by the Ears, thus, I have also checked and quell'd
those forbidden curiosities, which would have
given the <i>Devil</i> an invitation to have tarried
amongst us, when I have seen wonderful <i>Snares</i>
laid for <i>Curious</i> People, by the secret and future
things discovered from the <i>Mouths of Damsels
possest with a Spirit of divination</i>; Indeed I can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>recollect but one thing wherein there could be
given so much as a Shadow of Reason for <i>Exceptions</i>,
and that is my allowing of so many to come
and see those that were <i>Afflicted</i>,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> now for that I
have this to say, that I have almost <i>a Thousand
times</i> intreated the Friends of the Miserable, that
they would not permit the Intrusion of any Company,
but such as <i>by Prayers</i> or other ways might
be helpful to them; Nevertheless I have not absolutely
forbid all Company from coming to your
Haunted Chambers, partly because the Calamities
of the Families were such as required the Assistance
of <i>many friends</i>; partly because I have been
willing that there should be <i>disinterested Witnesses</i>
of all sorts, to confute the Calumnies of such as
would say <i>all was but Imposture</i>; and partly because
I saw God had Sanctified the Spectacle of
the Miseries on the Afflicted unto the Souls of
many that were Spectators, and it is a very Glorious
thing that I have now to mention&mdash;The
Devils have with most horrendous operations broke
in upon our Neighbourhood, and God has at such
a rate over-ruled all the Fury and Malice of those
Devils, that all the Afflicted have not only been
<i>Delivered</i>, but I hope also savingly brought home
unto God, and the Reputation of <i>no one</i> good
Person in the World, has been damaged, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
instead thereof the Souls of many, especially of
the rising Generation, have been thereby awaken'd
unto some acquaintance with <i>Religion</i>, our
young People who belonged unto the <i>Praying
Meetings</i> of both Sexes, a part would ordinarily
spend whole <i>Nights</i> by whole Weeks together in
<i>Prayers</i> and Psalms upon these occasions, in
which Devotions the Devils could get nothing
but like <i>Fools a Scourge for their own Backs</i>, and
some scores of other young People who were
strangers to real Piety, were now struck with the
lively demonstrations of <i>Hell</i> evidently set forth
before their Eyes, when they saw Persons cruelly
Frighted, wounded and Starved by Devils and
Scalded with burning <i>Brimstone</i>, and yet so preserved
in this tortured estate as that at the end of
one Months wretchedness they were as able still
to undergo another, so that of these also it might
now be said, Behold they Pray in the whole&mdash;the
Devil got just nothing; but God got praises,
Christ got Subjects, the Holy Spirit got <i>Temples</i>,
the Church got <i>Addition</i>, and the Souls of Men
got everlasting <i>Benefits</i>; I am not so vain as to say
that any <i>Wisdome</i> or <i>Vertue</i> of mine did contribute
unto this good order of things: But I am
so just, as to say I did not hinder this Good. [<a id="a13a"></a>13]
When therefore there have been those that pickt
up little incoherent scraps and bits of my <i>Discourses</i>
in this fruitful discharge of my Ministry,
and so traversted 'em in their abusive <i>Pamphlets</i>,
as to perswade the Town that I was their <i>common</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
<i>Enemy</i> in those very points, wherein, if in any one
thing whatsoever I have sensibly approved myself
as true a Servant unto 'em as possibly I could,
tho my Life and Soul had been at Stake for it.
Yea to do like <i>Satan</i> himself, by sly, base, unpretending
<i>Insinuations</i>, as if I wore not the Modesty
and Gravity which became a Minister of the
Gospel, I could not but think myself unkindly
dealt withal, and the neglects of <i>others</i> to do me

this Narrative with complaints in <i>another hearing</i>
of such Monstrous Injuries.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p class="dropcap">I<i>N the Evening when the Sun was withdrawn,
giving place to Darkness to succeed, I with some
others were drawn by curiosity to see</i> Margaret Rule,
<i>and so much the rather because it was reported</i> Mr.
M&mdash;&mdash; <i>would be there that Night: Being come to
her Fathers House</i><a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
<i>into the Chamber wherein she
was in Bed, found her of a healthy countenance of
about seventeen Years Old, lying very still, and
speaking very little, what she did say seem'd as if
she were Light-headed. Then Mr.</i> M&mdash;&mdash; <i>Father
and Son</i><a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
<i>came up and others with them, in the whole
were about 30 or 40 Persons, they being sat, the
Father on a Stool, and the Son upon the Bedside by
her, the Son began to question her</i>, Margaret Rule,
<i>how do you do</i>? then a pause without any answer.
Question. <i>What do there a great many Witches sit
upon you? Answer.</i> Yes. Q. <i>Do you not know
that there is a hard Master?</i> Then she was in a
Fit; <i>He laid his hand upon her Face and Nose,
but, as he said, without perceiving Breath; then he
brush'd her on the Face with his Glove, and rubb'd
her Stomach (her breast not covered with the
Bedcloaths) and bid others do so too, and said</i> [14]
<i>it eased her, then she revived.</i> Q. <i>Don't you know
there is a hard Master?</i> A. <i>Yes.</i> Reply; <i>Don't
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>serve that hard Master, you know who.</i> Q. <i>Do
you believe? Then again she was in a Fit, and he
again rub'd her Breast</i>, &amp;c. (<i>about this time</i> Margaret
Perd<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> <i>an attendant assisted him in rubbing of
her. The Afflicted spake angerely to her saying
don't you meddle with me, and hastily put away her
hand</i>) <i>he wrought his Fingers before her Eyes and
asked her if she saw the Witches</i>? A. <i>No.</i> Q.
<i>Do you believe?</i> A. <i>Yes.</i> Q. <i>Do you believe in you
know who?</i> A. <i>Yes.</i> Q. <i>Would you have other
people do so too, to believe in you know who?</i> A.
<i>Yes.</i> Q. <i>Who is it that Afflicts you?</i> A. <i>I know
not, there is a great many of them</i> (<i>about this time
the Father question'd if she knew the Spectres? An
attendant said, if she did she would not tell; The
Son proceeded.</i>) Q. <i>You have seen the Black-man,
hant you?</i> A. <i>No.</i> Reply, <i>I hope you never shall.</i>
Q. <i>You have had a Book offered you, hant you?</i>
A. <i>No.</i> Q. <i>The brushing of you gives you ease,
don't it?</i> A. <i>Yes. She turn'd herselfe and a little
Groan'd.</i> Q. <i>Now the Witches Scratch you and
Pinch you, and Bite you, don't they?</i> A. <i>Yes, then
he put his hand upon her Breast and Belly</i>, viz. <i>on
the Cloaths over her, and felt a Living thing, as he
said, which moved the Father also to feel, and some
others</i>. Q. <i>Don't you feel the Live thing in the
Bed?</i> A. <i>No.</i> Reply, <i>that is only Fancie</i>. Q.
<i>the great company of People increase your Torment,
don't they?</i> A. <i>Yes. The People about were desired
to withdraw. One Woman said, I am sure I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>am no Witch, I will not go; so others, so none withdrew.</i>
Q. <i>Shall we go to Prayers, Then she lay in
a Fit as before. But this time to revive her, they
waved a Hat and brushed her Head and Pillow
therewith.</i> Q. <i>Shall we go to PRAY</i>, &amp;c. <i>Spelling
the Word.</i> A. <i>Yes. The Father went to
Prayer for perhaps half an Hour,</i><a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> <i>chiefly against
the Power of the Devil and Witchcraft, and that
God would bring out the Afflicters: during Prayer-time,
the Son stood by, and when they thought she
was in a Fit, rub'd her and brush'd her as before,
and beckned to others to do the like, after Prayer
he proceeded</i>; Q. <i>You did not hear when we were
at Prayer, did you?</i> A. <i>Yes. You dont hear
always, you dont hear sometimes past a Word or
two, do you?</i> A. <i>No. Then turning him about
said, this is just another</i> Mercy Short: Margaret
Perd <i>reply'd, she was not like her in her
Fits</i>. Q. <i>What does she eat or drink?</i> A. Not
eat at all; but drink Rum. <i>Then he admonished
the young People to take warning</i>, &amp;c. <i>Saying it
was a sad thing to be so Tormented by the Devil
and his Instruments</i>: A <i>Young-man present in the
habit of a Seaman, reply'd this is the Devil all
over, Than the Ministers withdrew. Soon after
they were gone the Afflicted desired the Women to
be gone, saying, that the Company of the Men was
not offensive to her, and having hold of the hand of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>a Young-man, said to have been her Sweetheart
formerly, who was withdrawing; she pull'd him
again into his Seat, saying he should not go to Night.</i></p>

<p class="right p2">[15] September <i>the</i> 19<i>th</i>, 1693.</p>

<p class="dropcap">T<i>HIS Night I renew'd my Visit, and found her
rather of a fresher Countenance than before,
about eight Persons present with her, she was in a
Fit Screeming and making a Noise: Three or four
Persons rub'd and brush'd her with their hands,
they said that the brushing did put them away, if
they brush'd or rub'd in the right place; therefore
they brushed and rubbed in several places, and said
that when they did it in the right place she could
fetch her Breath, and by that they knew. She
being come to herself was soon in a merry talking
Fit. A Young-man came in and ask'd her how she
did? She answered very bad, but at present a little
better; he soon told her he must be gone and bid her
good Night, at which she seem'd troubled, saying that
she liked his Company; and said she would not have
him go till she was well; adding, for I shall Die
when you are gone. Then she complained they did
not put her on a clean Cap, but let her ly so like a
Beast, saying she should lose her Fellows. She said
she wondered any People should be so Wicked as to
think she was not Afflicted, but to think she Dissembled,
A Young-woman answered Yes, If they were
to see you in this merry Fit, they would say you Dissembled
indeed; She reply'd, Mr.</i> M&mdash;&mdash; <i>said this
was her laughing time, she must laugh now: She said</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
<i>Mr.</i> M&mdash;&mdash; <i>had been there this Evening, and she enquired,
how long he had been gon? She said he
stay'd alone with her in the room half an Hour, and
said that he told her there were some that came for
Spies, and to report about Town that she was not
Afflicted. That during the said time she had no
Fit, that he asked her if she knew how many times
he had Prayed for her to day? And that she answered
that she could not tell; and that he reply'd
he had Prayed for her Nine times to Day; the Attendants
said that she was sometimes in a Fit that
none could open her Joints</i><a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> <i>and that there came an
Old Iron-jaw'd Woman and try'd, but could not do
it; they likewise said, that her Head could not be
moved from the Pillow; I try'd to move her head,
and found no more difficulty than another Bodies
(and so did others) but was not willing to offend by
lifting it up, one being reproved for endeavouring it,
they saying Angrily you will break her Neck. The
Attendants said Mr.</i> M&mdash;&mdash; <i>would not go to Prayer
with her when People were in the Room, as they
did one Night that Night he felt the Live-Creature.</i>
Margaret Perd <i>and another, said they smelt brimstone;</i><a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
<i>I and others said we did not smell any;
then they said they did not know what it was: This</i>
Margaret <i>said, she wish'd she had been here when
Mr.</i> M&mdash;&mdash; <i>was here, another Attendant said, if you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>had been here you might not have been permitted in,
for her own Mother was not suffered to be present.</i></p>

<p>Sir, after the sorest Affliction and greatest blemish
to Religion that ever befel this Countrey, and
after most Men began to Fear that some undue
steps had been taken, and after His Excellency
(with their Majestyes Approbation as is said) had
put a stop to Executions, and Men began [<a id="a16a"></a>16] to
hope there would never be a return of the like;
finding these Accounts to contain in them something
extraordinary, I writ them down the same
Nights in order to attain the certainty of them,
and soon found them so confirmed that I have
(besides other Demonstrations) the whole, under
the Hands of two Persons are ready to attest
the Truth of it, but not satisfied herewith; I
shewed them to some of your particular Friends,
that so I might have the greater certainty: But
was much surprised with the Message you sent
me, that I should be Arrested for Slander, and at
your calling me one of the worst of Lyars, making
it Pulpit-news with the Name of <i>Pernicious Libels</i>,
&amp;c. This occasion'd my first Letter.</p>

if it were so was past any Power of mine to
remedy, having given a faithful account of all
that came to my knowledge; And Sir, that you

November <i>the</i> 24<i>th</i>, 1693.</p>
<p>
Reverend SIR,
</p>

<p class="dropcap">H<i>AVING expected some Weeks, your meeting me
at Mr.</i> Wilkins <i>according to what you intimated
to me</i>, J. M&mdash;&mdash; <i>and the time drawing near
for our meeting elsewhere, I thought it not amiss to
give you a Summary of my thoughts in the great
concern, which as you say has been agitated with so
much</i> [17] <i>heat. That there are Witches is not the
doubt, the Scriptures else were in vain, which assign
their Punishment to be by death; But what this
Witchcraft is, or wherein it does consist, seems to be
the whole difficulty: And as it may be easily demonstrated,
that all that bear that Name cannot be
justly so accounted, so that some things and Actions
not so esteemed by the most, yet upon due examination
will be found to merit no better Character</i>.</p>

<p><i>In your late Book you lay down a brief Synopsis
of what has been written on that Subject, by a</i> Triumvirate
<i>of as Eminent Men as ever handled it</i><a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
(<i>as you are pleas'd to call them</i>) viz. <i>Mr.</i> Perkins,
Gaule, <i>and</i> Bernard <i>consisting of about 30 Tokens
to know them by, many of them distinct from, if not
thwarting each other: Among all of which I can
find but one decisive</i>, Viz. <i>That of Mr.</i> Gaule,
<i>Head</i> IV. <i>and runs thus; Among the most unhappy
Circumstances to convict a Witch, one is a maligning
and oppugning the Word, Work, or Worship of God,
and by any extraordinary Sign seeking to seduce any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>from it, see</i> Deu. 13. 1, 2. Mat. 24. 24. Acts. 13.
8, 10. 2. Tim. 3. 8. <i>Do but mark well the places,
and for this very property of thus opposing and perverting,
they are all there concluded Arrant and
absolute Witches.</i></p>

<p><i>This Head as here laid down and inserted by you,
either is a Truth or not, if not, why is it here inserted
from one of the</i> Triumvirate <i>if it be a Truth.
as the Scriptures quoted will abundantly testifie,
whence is it that it is so little regarded, tho it be the
only Head well proved by Scripture, or that the rest
of the</i> Triumvirate <i>should so far forget their Work
as not to mention it. It were to be unjust to the
Memory of those otherwise Wise Men, to suppose
them to have any Sinister design; But perhaps the
force of a prevailing opinion, together with an Education
thereto Suited, might overshadow their Judgments,
as being wont to be but too prevalent in many
other cases. But if the above be Truth, then the
Scripture is full and plain, What is Witchcraft?
And if so, what need of his next Head of Hanging
of People without as full and clear Evidence as in
other Cases? Or what need of the rest of the Receipts
of the</i> Triumvirate? <i>what need of Praying
that the Afflicted may be able to discover who 'tis
that Afflicts them? or what need of Searching for
Tet's for the Devil to Suck in his Old Age, or the
Experiment of saying the Lord's Prayer</i>, &amp;c. <i>Which
a multitude more practised in some places Superstitiously
inclin'd. Other Actions have been practised
for easing the Afflicted, less justifiable, if not strongly</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
<i>savouring of Witchcraft itself</i>, viz. <i>Fondly Imagining
by the Hand, &amp;c. to drive off Spectres, or to
knock off Invisible Chains, or by striking in the Air
to Wound either the Afflicted or others</i>, &amp;c. <i>I write
not this to accuse any, but that all may beware believing,
That the Devil's bounds are set, which he
cannot pass, That the Devils are so full of Malice,
That it cannot be added to by Mankind, That where
he hath Power he neither can nor will omit Executing
it, That 'tis only the Almighty that sets</i> [18]
<i>bounds to his rage, and that only can Commissionate
him to hurt or destroy any</i>.</p>

<p><i>These last, Sir, are such Foundations of Truth,
in my esteem, that I cannot but own it to be my duty
to ascert them, when call'd, tho' with the hazard of
my All.</i><a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
<i>And consequently to detect such as these,
That a Witch can Commissionate Devils to Afflict
Mortals, That he can at his or the Witches pleasure
Assume any Shape, That Hanging or Drawing of
Witches can lessen his Power of Afflicting, or restore
those that were at a distance Tormented, with many
others depending on these; all tending, in my esteem,
highly to the Dishonour of God, and the Indangering
the well-being of a People, and do further add, that
as the Scriptures are full that there is Witchcraft</i>,
(ut sup.) <i>so 'tis as plain that there are Possessions,
and that the Bodies of the Possest have hence been
not only Afflicted, but strangely agitated, if not their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>tongues improved to foretell futurities, &amp;c. and why
not to accuse the Innocent, as bewitching them;
having pretence to Divination to gain credence.
This being reasonable to be expected, from him who
is the Father of Lies, to the end he may thereby involve
a Countrey in Blood, Mallice, and Evil, surmising
which he greedily seeks after, and so finally
lead them from their fear and dependance upon God
to fear him, and a supposed Witch thereby attaining
his end upon Mankind; and not only so, but Natural
Distemper, as has been frequently observed by the
Judicious, have so operated as to deceive, more than
the Vulgar, as is testified by many Famous Physicians,
and others. And as for that proof of Multitudes
of Confessions, this Countrey may be by this
time thought Competent Judges, what credence we
ought to give them, having had such numerous Instances,
as also how obtain'd</i>.</p>

<p><i>And now Sir, if herein be any thing in your
esteem valuable, let me intreat you, not to account it
the worse for coming from so mean a hand; which
however you may have receiv'd Prejudices</i>, &amp;c. <i>Am
ready to serve you to my Power; but if you Judge
otherwise hereof, you may take your own Methods for
my better Information. Who am, Sir, yours to
command, in what I may</i>,</p>

<p class="right">
<i>P. C.</i><a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
</p>

<p>In Answer to this last, Sir, you replyed to the
Gentleman that presented it, that you had nothing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>to Prosecute against me; and said as to your Sentiments
in your Books, you did not bind any to
believe them, and then again renew'd your promise
of meeting me, as before, tho' not yet performed.
Accordingly, tho' I waited at Sessions,
there was none to object ought against me, upon
which I was dismissed. This gave me some reason
to believe that you intended all should have been
forgotten; But instead of that, I find the Coals
are fresh blown up, I being supposed to be represented,
in a late Manuscript, <i>More Wonders of the,
&amp;c.</i> as traversing your Discourse in your Faithful
discharge of your Duty, <i>&amp;c.</i> And such as see not
with the Authors Eyes, rendred <i>Saducees</i> and
<i>Witlins</i>,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> <i>&amp;c.</i> and the Arguments that square not
with the Sentiments [<a id="a19a"></a>19] therein contain'd, Buffoonary;
rarely no doubt, agreeing with the Spirit
of Christ, and his dealings with an unbelieving
<i>Thomas</i>, yet whose infidelity was without compare
less excusable, but the Author having resolved
long since, to have no more than one single Grain
of Patience, with them that deny, <i>&amp;c.</i> the Wonder
is the less. It must needs be that offences
come, but wo to him by whom they come. To
vindicate myself therefore from such false Imputations,
of <i>Satan-like</i> insinuations, and misrepresenting
your Actions, <i>&amp;c.</i> and to vindicate yourself,
Sir, as much as is in my power from those
suggestions, said to be insinuated, as if you wore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>not the Modesty, and Gravity, that becomes a
Minister of the <i>Gospel</i>; which it seems, some that
never saw the said Narratives, report them to
contain; I say, Sir, for these reasons, I here present
you with the first Coppy that ever was taken,
<i>&amp;c.</i> And purpose for a Weeks time to be ready,
if you shall intimate your pleasure to wait upon
you, either at the place formerly appointed, or
any other that is indifferent to the End; that if
there shall appear any defects in that Narrative,
they may be amended.</p>

<p>Thus, Sir, I have given you a genuine account
of my Sentiments and Actions in this Affair; and
do request and pray, that if I err, I may be
shewed it from <i>Scripture</i>, or sound <i>Reason</i>, and
not by quotations out of <i>Virgil</i>, nor <i>Spanish
Rhetorick</i>.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> For I find the <i>Witlings</i> mentioned,
are so far from answering your profound questions,
that they cannot so much as pretend to shew a
distinction between Witchcraft in the Common
notion of it, and Possession; Nor so much as to
demonstrate that ever the <i>Jews</i> or primitive
<i>Christians</i> did believe, that a Witch could send a
Devil to Afflict her Neighbours; but to all these,
Sir, (ye being the Salt of the Earth, <i>&amp;c.</i>) I have
reason to hope for a Satisfactory Answer to him,
who is one that reverences your Person and Office;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
And am, Sir, yours to Command in what I
may,</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<div class="sidenote"><i>A Letter of Mr. C. M.</i></div>
<p class="right">
<i>Boston, January the</i> 15<i>th</i>, 169¾.</p>
<p>
<i>Mr.</i> R. C.
</p>

<p class="dropcap">WHEREAS you intimate your desires, that
what's not fairly (I take it for granted you
mean truly also,) represented in a Paper you lately
sent me, containing a pretended Narrative of a
Visit by my Father and self to an Afflicted Young
woman, whom we apprehended to be under a
<i>Diabolical Possession</i>, might be rectified: I have
this to say, as I have often already said, that do I
scarcely find any one thing in the whole Paper,
whether respecting my Father or self, either fairly
or truly represented. Nor can I think that any
that know my Parents Circumstances, but must
think him deserving a better Character by far,
than this Narrative can be thought to give him.
When the main design we managed in [20] Visiting
the poor Afflicted Creature, was to prevent
the Accusations of the Neighbourhood; can it
be fairly represented that our design was to draw
out such Accusations, which is the representation
of the Paper. We have Testimonies of the best
Witnesses and in Number not a few, That when
we asked <i>Rule</i> whether she thought she knew
who Tormented her? the Question was but an
Introduction to the Solemn charges which we
then largely gave, that she should rather Dye than
tell the Names of any whom she might Imagine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
that she knew. Your Informers have reported
the Question, and report nothing of what follows,
as essential to the giving of that Question:
And can this be termed a piece of fairness? Fair
it cannot be, that when Ministers Faithfully and
Carefully discharge their Duty to the Miserable
in their Flock, little bits, scraps and shreds of
their Discourses, should be tackt together to make
them contemtible, when there shall be no notice
of all the Necessary, Seasonable, and Profitable
things that occurr'd, in those Discourses; And
without which, the occasion of the lesser Passages
cannot be understood; and yet I am furnished
with abundant Evidences, ready to be Sworn, that
will possitively prove this part of unfairness, by
the above mention'd Narrative, to be done both
to my Father and self. Again, it seems not fair
or reasonable that I should be expos'd, for which
your self (not to say some others) might have
expos'd me for, if I had not done, <i>viz.</i> for discouraging
so much Company from flocking about
the Possest Maid, and yet, as I perswade myself,
you cannot but think it to be good advice, to
keep much Company from such haunted Chambers;
besides the unfairness doth more appear, in
that I find nothing repeated of what I said about
the advantage, which the Devil takes from too
much Observation and Curiosity.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
 In that several of the Questions in the Paper
are so Worded, as to carry in them a presupposal
of the things inquired after, to say the best of it
is very unfair: But this is not all, the Narrative
contains a number of Mistakes and Falshoods;
which were they wilful and design'd, might justly
be termed gross Lies. The representations are
far from true, when 'tis affirm'd my Father and
self being come into the Room, I began the Discourse;
I hope I understand breeding a little
better than so: For proof of this, did occasion
serve, sundry can depose the contrary.</p>

<p>'Tis no less untrue, that either my Father or
self put the Question, how many Witches sit
upon you? We always cautiously avoided that
expression; It being contrary to our inward belief:
All the standers by will (I believe) swear
they did not hear us use it (your Witnesses excepted)
and I tremble to think how hardy those
woful Creatures must be, to call the Almighty by
an Oath, to so false a thing. As false a representation
'tis, that I rub'd <i>Rule's</i> Stomach, her
Breast not being covered. The Oath of the
nearest Spectators, giving a true account of that
matter [21] will prove this to be little less than a
gross (if not a doubled) Lie; and to be somewhat
plainer, it carries the Face of a Lie contrived on
purpose (by them at least, to whom you are be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>holden
for the Narrative) Wickedly and Basely to
expose me. For you cannot but know how
much this representation hath contributed, to
make People believe a Smutty thing of me; I
am far from thinking, but that in your own Conscience
you believe, that no indecent Action of
that Nature could then be done by me before
such observers, had I been so Wicked as to have
been inclin'd to what is Base. It looks next to
impossible that a reparation shoud be made me
for the wrong done to, I hope, as to any Scandal
an unblemish'd, tho' weak and small Servant of
the Church of God. Nor is what follows a less
untruth, that 'twas an Attendant and not myself
who said, if <i>Rule</i> knows who Afflicts her, yet she
wont tell. I therefore spoke it that I might encourage
her to continue in that concealment of
all Names whatsoever; to this I am able to furnish
myself with the Attestation of Sufficient
Oaths. 'Tis as far from true, that my apprehension
of the Imp, about <i>Rule</i>, was on her Belly,
for the Oaths of the Spectators, and even of those
that thought they felt it, can testify that 'twas
upon the Pillow, at a distance from her Body.
As untrue a Representation is that which follows,
<i>Viz.</i> That it was said unto her, that her not
Apprehending of that odd palpable tho' not visible,
Mover was from her Fancy, for I endeavoured
to perswade her that it might be but Fancy in
others, that there was any such thing at all.
Witnesses every way sufficient can be produced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
for this also. 'tis falsely represented that my
Father felt on the Young-woman after the appearance
mentioned, for his hand was never near
her; Oath can sufficiently vindicate him. 'Tis
very untrue, that my Father Prayed for perhaps
half an Hour, against the power of the Devil
and Witchcraft, and that God would bring out
the Afflictors. Witnesses of the best Credit, can
depose, that his Prayer was not a quarter of an
Hour, and that there was no more than about one
clause towards the close of the Prayer, which was
of this import; and this clause also was guarded
with a singular wariness and modesty, <i>viz.</i> If
there were any evil Instruments in this matter
God would please to discover them: And that
there was more than common reason for that
petition I can satisfie any one that will please to
Inquire of me. And strange it is, that a Gentleman
that from 18 to 54 hath been an Exemplary
Minister of the Gospel; and that besides a station
in the Church of God, as considerable as any that
his own Country can afford, hath for divers years
come off with honour, in his Application to three
Crown'd Heads, and the chiefest Nobility of three
Kingdoms, knows not yet how to make one short
Prayer of a quarter of an hour, but in <i>New-England</i>
he must be Libell'd for it. There are
divers other down-right mistakes, which you [<a id="a22a"></a>22]
have permitted yourself, I would hope, not knowingly,
and with a Malicious design, to be receiver
or Compiler of, which I shall now forbear to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
Animadvert upon. As for the Appendix of the
Narrative I do find myself therein Injuriously
treated, for the utmost of your proof for what
you say of me, amounts to little more than, <i>viz.</i>
Some People told you, that others told them, that
such and such things did pass, but you may assure
yourself, that I am not unfurnish'd with Witnesses,
that can convict the same. Whereas you would
give me to believe the bottom of these your
Methods, to be some dissatisfaction about the
commonly receiv'd Power of <i>Devils</i> and <i>Witches</i>;
I do not only with all freedom offer you the use
of any part of my Library, which you may see
cause to peruse on that Subject, but also if you
and any else, whom you please, will visit me
at my Study, yea, or meet me at any other place,
less inconvenient than those by you propos'd; I
will with all the fairness and calmness in the
World dispute the point. I beg of God that he
would bestow as many Blessings on you, as ever
on myself, and out of a sincere wish, that you
may be made yet more capable of these Blessings,
I take this occasion to lay before you the faults
(not few nor small ones neither) which the Paper
contained, you lately sent me, in order to be Examined
by me. In case you want a true and full
Narrative of my Visit, whereof such an indecent
Traversty (to say the best) hath been made, I am
not unwilling to communicate it, in mean time
must take liberty to say, 'Tis scarcely consistent
with Common Civility, much less Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
Charity, to offer the Narrative, now with you,
for a true one, till you have a truer, or for a full
one, till you have a fuller. Your Sincere (tho'

Assistance from any use of her own Arms or
Hands, or any other part of her Body, not so
much as her Heels touching her Bed, or resting
on any support whatsoever. And I have seen her
thus lifted, when not only a strong Person hath
thrown his whole weight a cross her to pull her
down; but several other Persons have endeavoured,
with all their might, to hinder her from
being so raised up, which I suppose that several

<p class="right">
<i>Boston, January</i> 18, 1693.</p>
<p class="in4">
Mr. <i>Cotton Mather</i>,</p>
<p>
<i>Reverend SIR</i>,
</p>

<p class="dropcap">YOURS of the 15<i>th</i> Instant, I receiv'd yesterday;
and soon found I had promised myself
too much by it, <i>viz</i>, Either concurrence with, or
a denial of those Fundamentals mentioned in
mine, of <i>Novemb.</i> the 24<i>th.</i> finding this waved
by an Invitation to your Library, <i>&amp;c.</i> I thank
God I have the Bible, and do Judge that sufficient
to demonstrate that cited Head of Mr. <i>Gaule</i>, to
be a Truth, as also those other Heads mentioned,
as the Foundations of Religion. And in my apprehension,
if it be asked any Christian, whether
God governs the World, and whether it be he
only can Commissionate Devils, and such other
Fundamentals, He ought to be as ready as in the
Question, who made him? (a little Writing certainly
might be of more use, to clear up the controverted
points, than either looking over many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>Books in a well furnish'd Library, or than a dispute,
if I were qualified for it; the Inconveniencies
of Passion being this way best avoided) And
am not without hopes that you will yet oblige
me so far, as to consider that Letter, and if I Err,
to let me see it by Scripture, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Yours, almost the whole of it, is concerning
the Narrative I sent to you, and you seem to intimate
as if I were giving Characters, Reflecti[24]ons,
and Libell's, <i>&amp;c.</i> concerning yourself and
Relations; all which were as far from my
thoughts, as ever they were in writing after either
yourself, or any other Minister. In the front you
declare your apprehension to be, that the Afflicted
was under a Diabolical Possession, and if so, I see
not how it should be occasion'd by any Witchcraft
(unless we ascribe that Power to a Witch,
which is only the Prerogative of the Almighty,
of Sending or Commissionating the Devils to
Afflict her.) But to your particular Objections
against the Narrative; and to the first my intelligence
not giving me any further, I could not
insert that I knew not. And it seems improbable
that a Question should be put, whether she knew
(or rather who they were) and at the same time
to charge her, and that upon her Life, not to tell,
and if you had done so, I see but little good you
could promise yourself or others by it, she being
Possest, as also having it inculcated so much to
her of Witchcraft. And as to the next Objection
about company flocking, <i>&amp;c.</i> I do profess my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
Ignorance, not knowing what you mean by it.
And Sir, that most of the Questions did carry
with them a presupposing the things inquired
after, is evident, if there were such as those
relating to the <i>Black-man</i> and a Book, and about
her hearing the Prayer, <i>&amp;c.</i> (related in the said
Narrative, which I find no Objection against.)
As to that which is said of mentioning yourself
first discoursings and your hopes that your breeding
was better (I doubt it not) nor do I doubt
your Father might first apply himself to others;
but my intelligence is, that you first spake to the
Afflicted or Possessed, for which you had the advantage
of a nearer approach. The next two
Objections are founded upon mistakes: I find
not in the Narrative any such Question, as
how many Witches sit upon you? and that her
Breast was not covered, in which those material
words, (with the Bed-Cloaths) are wholly omitted;
I am not willing to retort here your own
Language upon you; but can tell you, that your
own discourse of it publickly, at Sir <i>W. P</i>'s Table,
has much more contributed to, <i>&amp;c.</i> As to the
Reply, if she could she would not tell, whether
either or both spake it it matters not much.
Neither does the Narrative say you felt the live
thing on her Belly; tho I omit now to say what
further demonstrations there are of it. As to
that Reply, that is only her fancy, I find the
word (her) added. And as to your Fathers feeling
for the live Creature after you had felt it, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
it were on the Bed it was not so very far from
her. And for the length of his Prayer, possibly
your Witnesses might keep a more exact account
of the time than those others, and I stand not for
a few Minutes. For the rest of the Objections
I suppose them of less moment, if less can be
(however shall be ready to receive them, those
matters of greatest concern I find no Objections
against) these being all that yet appear, it may be
thought that if the Narrative be not [<a id="a25a"></a>25] fully
exact, it was as near as Memory could bear away;
but should be glad to see one more perfect (which
yet is not to be expected, seeing none writ at the
time.) You mention the appendix, by which I
understand the Second Visit, and if you be by the
possessed belyed (as being half an hour with her
alone (excluding her own Mother) and as telling
her you had Prayed for her Nine times that day,
and that now was her Laughing time, she must
Laugh now) I can see no Wonder in it; what
can be expected less from the Father of Lies, by
whom, you Judge, she was possest.</p>

<p>And besides the above Letter, you were pleased
to send me another Paper containing several Testimonies
of the Possessed being lifted up, and
held a space of several Minutes to the Garret
floor, <i>&amp;c.</i> but they omit giving the account,
whether after she was down they bound her
down: or kept holding her: And relate not
how many were to pull her down, which hinders
the knowledge what number they must be to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
stronger than an Invisible Force. Upon the
whole, I suppose you expect I should believe it;
and if so, the only advantage gain'd, is that which
has been so long controverted between Protestants
and Papists, whether miracles are ceast, will
hereby seem to be decided for the latter; it
being, for ought I can see, if so, as true a Miracle
as for Iron to swim, and that the Devil can work
such Miracles.</p>

<p>But Sir, leaving these little disputable things, I
do again pray that you would let me have the
happiness of your approbation or confutation of
that Letter before referred to.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>And now, Sir, that the God of all Grace may
enable us Zealously to own his Truths, and to
follow those things that tend to Peace, and that
yourself may be as an useful Instrument in his
hand, effectually to ruin the remainders of
Heathenish and Popish Superstitions, is the
earnest desire and prayer of yours to command,
in what I may. </p>
<p class="right">R. C.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Postscript</i>&mdash;Sir, I here send you the Coppy of
a paper that lately came to my Hands, which tho'
it contains no Wonders, yet is remarkable, and
Runs thus.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Cotton Mather</i>,
</p>

<p class="dropcap">Reverend Sir, Having received as yet no
Answer to mine of <i>Novemb.</i> the 24th. except
an offer to peruse Books, <i>&amp;c.</i> relating to the Doctrinals
therein contain'd: Nor to my last of <i>January</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
the 18th. In which I did again pray that if

I err'd I might be shewed it by Scripture, <i>Viz.</i> in
believing that the Devils bounds are sett, which
he cannot pass; that the Devils are so full of
Malice that it cant be added to by Mankind:
That where he hath power he neither can nor
will omit Executing it; That it's only the Almighty
that sets bounds to his rage, and that only
can commissionate him to hurt or destroy any;
And consequently to detest as erroneous and dangerous,
the belief that a Witch can Commissionate
Devils to Afflict Mortals; That he can at his or
the Witches pleasure assume any shape: That
Hanging or Chaining of Witches can lessen his
Power of Afflicting, and restore those that were,
at a distance, Tormented by him. And whether
Witchcraft ought to be understood now in this
Age, to be the same that it was when the Divine
Oracles were given forth, particularly, those quoted
by Mr. <i>Gaule</i> in that cited Head (<i>Wonders of the
Invisible World</i>;<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Mr. <i>Gaules</i> IV. Head, to discover
Witches) which do so plainly shew a Witch,
in Scripture-sense to be one that maligne, <i>&amp;c.</i>
And that pretend to give a Sign in order to seduce,
<i>&amp;c.</i> For I have never understood in my
time, any such have Suffered as Witches, tho'
sufficiently known; But the only Witch now
inquired after, is one that is said to become so by
making an Explicit Covenant with the Devil, <i>i. e.</i>
the Devil appearing to them, and making a compact
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
mutually, promising each to other, testified
by their signing his Book, a material Book, which
he is said to keep and that thereby they are Intituled
to a power, not only to Afflict others, but
such as is truly exorbitant, if not highly intrenching
upon the prerogative of him, who is the
Soveraign being; For who is he that saith, and
it cometh to pass, when the Lord commandeth
it not.</p>

<p>Such explicit Covenant being as is said in this
Age reckoned essential to compleat a Witch: Yet
I finding nothing of such covenant (or power
thereby obtain'd) in Scripture, and yet a Witch
therein so fully describ'd, do pray that if there be
any such Scriptures I may be directed to them,
for as to the many Legends in this case I make
no account of them; I Read indeed of a Covenant
with Death and with Hell, but suppose that
to be in the Heart (or <i>Mental</i>) only, and see not
what use such explicit one can be of between
Spirits, any further than as 'tis a Copy of that
<i>Mental</i> which is in the Heart. The dire effects
and consequences of such notion may be found
written in indelible <i>Roman</i> Characters of Blood
in all Countryes where they have prevail'd, and
what can less be [<a id="a27a"></a>27] expected when Men are
Indicted for that, which, as 'tis impossible to
prove so, for any to clear himself of, <i>Viz,</i> Such
explicit Covenant with the Devil, and then for
want of better Evidence, must take up with such as
the Nature of such secret Covenant can bear, as Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
<i>Gaule</i> hath it, <i>i. e.</i> Distracted Stories, and strange
and Foreign Events, <i>&amp;c.</i> Thereby endeavouring
to find it, though by it's but supposed effects;
By the same Rules that one is put to purge
himself of such Compact, by the same may all
Mankind.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>This then being so Important a case, it concerns
all to know what Foundations in Scripture
is laid for such a Structure; For if they are deficient
of that Warrant, the more Eminent the
Architects are the more dangerous are they
thereby rendered, <i>&amp;c.</i> These are such considerations
as I think will vindicate me in the esteem
of all Lovers of Humanity, in my endeavours to
get them cleared. And to that End, do once
more pray, that you would so farr oblige me as to
give your Approbation or Confutation of the
above Doctrinals; But if you think silence a
Vertue in this case, I shall (I suppose) so far
comply with it as not to loose you any more
time to look over my papers. And if any others
will so far oblige me, I shall not be ungrateful to
them; Praying God to guide and prosper you, I
am, Sir, yours to my power,</p>

unwary expressions of the primative Fathers, were
afterwards improved for the Introducing and establishing
of Error, as their calling the Virgin

of her (the like might be said of the <i>Eucha</i>[29]<i>rist</i>,
these assertions, above rehearsed, being
apparently liable to a like Male Construction, and
no less dangerous, are therefore as I said highly
needful to be explain'd, and that in a most publick
manner. For were they to be understood
Litterally and as they are spoken, it must seem as
if the Authors were Introducing among Christians
very dangerous Doctrines, such, as were they asserted
by the best of Men, yet ought to be
rejected by all, <i>&amp;c. Viz.</i> That 'tis the Devil that
brings the most of Evils upon Mankind, by way
of Infliction, that do befall them; And that the
Witch can commissionate him to the performance
of these, with many others as dangerous Doctrines,
and such as seem in their tendency to look
favourably upon the Antient <i>Pagan</i> Doctrine of
this countrey, who did believe that God did hurt
to none, but Good to all, but that the Devil must
be pleas'd by Worshipping, <i>&amp;c.</i> From whom
came all their Miseries, as they believed. For
what were all this but to Rob God of his Glory
in the highest manner, and giving it to a Devil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
and a Witch; Is it not he that has said shall there
be Evil in a City and the Lord hath not done it?
But if any are fond of their own notions because
some Eminent Men have before now asserted
them; they may do well to compare them with
that excellent saying, <i>Wonders of the Invisible
World</i>, pag. 7. [<i>About this Devil there are many
things, whereof we may reasonably and profitably
be inquisitive, such things I mean as are in our Bibles
reveal'd to us; according to which if we do not
speak on so dark a Subject, but according to our
own uncertain and perhaps Humoursom Conjectures,
there is no Light in us.</i> Or that other, pag. 75.
<i>At every other Weapon the Devil will be too hard
for us.</i>] For 'tis most certain that other Notions,
Weapons and Practices have been taken up with;
And that the event has been answerable, the
Devil has been too hard for such as have so done.
I shall forbear to instance from the Dogmatical
part, and shall mention some practices that as
much need explaining. <i>Mem. provid. Relat. to

understand the wiles of <i>Satan</i>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
To which I have nothing to object, but it
might be a good Acknowledgment; But considering
that the Book is gone forth into all the
World, cannot but think the Salve ought to be
proportion'd to the Sore, and the notice of the
Devils wiles as Universal, as the means recommending
them. Another Practice is <i>pag.</i> 20, 21.
[<i>There was one singular passion that frequently attended
her, an Invisible Chain would be clapt about
her, and she in much pain and fear cry out when
they began to put it on, once I did with my own hand
knock it off as it began to be fastened about her.</i>] [<a id="a30a"></a>30]
If this were done by the power or Vertue of any
ord'nance of Divine Institution, it is well, but
would have been much better if the Institution
had been demonstrated, or was there any Physical
Vertue in that particular Hand. But supposing
that neither of these will be asserted by the Author,
I do think it very requisite, that the World
may be acquainted with the Operation, and to
what Art or Craft to refer their Power of Knocking
off <i>Invisible Chains</i>.</p>

<p class="dropcap">AFTER more than a Years waiting for the
performance of a reiterated promise from
one under singular obligations, and a multitude
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>of advantages to have done it sooner, The utmost
compliance I have mett with, is (by your Hands)
the sight of four Sheets of recinded Papers, but I
must first be obliged to return them in a Fortnight,
and not Copied, which I have now complied
with: And having read them am not at all
Surprized at the Authors Caution in it, not to
admit of such crude matter and impertinent absurdities,
as are to be found in it to spread. He
seems concern'd that I take no notice of his
several Books, wherein, as he saith, he has unanswerably
proved things to which I might reply,
that I have sent him letters of quotations out of
those Books, to know how much of them he will
abide by, for I thought it hard to affix their [31]
Natural consequences till he had opportunity to
explain them. And saith that he had sent me
(Mr. Baxters <i>World of Spirits</i>) an ungainsayable
Book, <i>&amp;c.</i> (tho I know no ungainsayable Book,
but the Bible) which Book I think no Man that
has read it, will give such a Title to but the Author,
he speaks of my reproaching his publick
Sermons, of which I am not conscious to myself,
unless it be about his interpretation of a <i>Thunder
Storm</i> (that broke into his House) which favoured
so much of Enthusiasm.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
As to those papers, I have (as I read them)
noted in the Margin where, in a hasty reading, I
thought it needful, of which it were unreasonable
for him to complain; seeing I might not take a
Copy, thereby to have been inabled, more at leasure
to digest what were needfull to be said on so
many Heads; and as I have not flatter'd him, so
for telling what was so needful, with the hazard
of making so many Enemies by it, I have approved
myself one of his best Friends: And
besides his own sense of the weakness of his Answer,
testified by the prohibition above, he has
wholly declined answering to most of those things
that I had his promise for, and what he pretends
to speak to, after mentioning, without the needful
Answer or Proof drops it.</p>

<p>His first main Work is after his definition of a
Witch, which he never proves (without saying
any thing to Mr. <i>Gauls</i> Scriptural description,
tho' so often urged to it, and tho' himself has in
his Book recommended and quoted it) is to magnifie
the Devils Power, and that as I think beyond
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>and against the Scripture, this takes him up about
11 <i>Pages</i>, and yet in <i>Page</i> 22 again returns to it,
and as I understand it, takes part with the <i>Pharisees</i>
against our Saviour in the Argument, for
they charge him that he cast out Devils thro'
<i>Beelzebub</i>, Our Saviours Answer is, <i>Mat.</i> xii. 25.
<i>Every Kingdom divided against itself is brought to
desolation; and every City or House divided against
itself, shall not stand, and if Satan cast out Satan,
he is divided against himself, how shall then his Kingdom
stand</i>: And yet notwithstanding this Answer
together with what follows, for further Illustration,
our Author is it seems resolved to assert that
our Saviour did not in this Answer deny that
many did so, (<i>viz.</i>) cast out Devils by <i>Beelzebub</i>,
and <i>Page</i> 23 grants that the Devils have a Miraculous
Power, but yet must not be call'd miracles,
and yet can be distinguished, as he intimates, only
by the Conscience or Light within, to the no
small scandal of the Christian Religion.</p>

<p>Tho' our Saviour and his Apostles accounts this
the chief or principal proof of his Godhead,
<i>John</i> xx. 30, 31. <i>John</i> x. 37, 38. <i>John</i> v. 30.
<i>Mark</i> xvi. 17, 18. <i>Acts</i> ii. 22. and iv. 30. with
many others and that Miracles belong only to
God, who also Governs the World, <i>Psal.</i> cxxxvi.
4. <i>Jer.</i> xiv. 22. <i>Isa.</i> xxxviii. 8. <i>Psal.</i> lxii. 11.
<i>Lam.</i> iii. 37. <i>Amos</i> iii. 6. [32] But to forbear
quoting that which the Scripture is most full in,
do only say that he that dares assert the Devil to
have such a Miraculous Power had need have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
other Scriptures than ever I have seen. In <i>Page</i>
12. our Author proceeds and states a question to
this effect, If the Devil has such Powers, and cant
exert them without permission from God, what
can the Witch contribute thereunto? Instead of
an Answer, to this weighty objection, our Author
first concedes that the Devil's do ordinarily exert
their Powers, without the Witches contributing
to it, but yet that to the end to increase their
guilt he may cheat a Witch, by making her believe
herself the Author of them.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> His next
is, if Witchcraft be, as I suppose it is, the skill of
applying the Plastic Spirit of the World, <i>&amp;c.</i> then
the consent of the Witch doth naturally contribute
to that mischiefs that the Devil does. And
his last answer runs to this effect, Is it not the
Ordination of God, that where the Devil can get
the consent of a Witch for the hurting of others,
the hurt shall as certainly be as if they had set
Mastiff Dogs upon them, or had given them
Poyson into their Bowels; and Gods Providence
must be as great in delivering from one as from
the other, and this it seems is not only his Belief,
but the most Orthodox and most learned answer
that our Author could pitch upon. If Witchcraft
be as I suppose it is, <i>&amp;c.</i> and is it not the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>Ordination of God, that, <i>&amp;c.</i> What is all this
but precarious, and begging the question, and a
plain dropping the Argument he cannot manage;
however, to amuse the Ignorant, and to confound
the Learned, he hooks in a cramp word, if not a
nonentity, (<i>viz.</i>) <i>Plastic</i> Spirit of the World, for
who is it either knows that there is a <i>Plastic Spirit</i>,
or what it is, or how this can any way serve his
purpose.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>He then proceeds to <i>Scripture</i> Instances of
Witches, <i>&amp;c.</i> and where I thought it needful, I
have, as I said, shewed my dissent from his Judgment:
He accounts it unreasonable to be held
to the proof of his definition of a Witch, which
he makes to consist in a Covenant with the Devil,
and chuses rather a tedious process about a Pistol
to defend him from it, which indeed is one particular
way whereby Murder has been Committed,
and so the Dore becomes Culpable; But his definition
of a <i>Witch</i>, which as I said, still remains
to be proved, is to this effect, That a <i>Witch</i> is one
that Covenants with, and Commissions <i>Devils</i> to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>do mischiefs, that she is one in Covenant, or that
by Vertue of such Covenant she can Commissionate
him to Kill. The not bringing Scripture to
prove these two, is a sufficient demonstration there
is none; and so that our Author leaves off just
where he began, <i>viz.</i> in a bare Assertion, together
with his own Biggoted experiences, hinting also
at multitudes of Histories to confirm him in the
belief of his definition. Here being all that I
take notice of to be considerable.</p>

<p>[<a id="a33a"></a>33] And now, Sir, if you think fit to improve
your Friendship with the Author for the Glory
of God, the Sovereign Being, the good and welfare
of <i>Mankind</i>, and for his real and true Interest,
as you see it convenient, put him in mind, That
the Glory of God is the end why <i>Mankind</i> was
made, and why <i>He</i> hath so many Advantages to
it. That the Flames we have seen threatning
the utter extirpation of the Country, must own
their Original to these dangerous Errors (if not
heresies) which if they remain Unextinguished,
may and most likely will be acted over again.</p>

<p>That 'tis more Honour to own an Error in
time, than tenaciously after full Conviction to retain
it. But if our Author will again Vindicate
such matters, please to acquaint him, that I shall
not any more receive his Papers, if I may not
Copy and use them; and that when he does,
instead of such abstruse matters, I still pray his
determination in those things I have his promise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
for. And thus begging Pardon for thus long
detaining of you, I am, Sir, your to Command,</p>

<h3 class="break"><i>To the Ministers, whether</i> English, French,
<i>or</i> Dutch,</h3>

<p class="dropcap">I Having had not only occasion, but renewed
provocation to take a view of the Mysterious
Doctrines, which have of late been so much contested
among us, could not meet with any that
had spoken more, or more plainly the sense of
those Doctrines (relating to the <i>Witchcraft</i>) than
the Reverend Mr. <i>C. M.</i> but how clearly and
consistent, either with himself or the truth, I
medle not now to say, but cannot but suppose his
strenuous and Zealous asserting his opinions, has
been one cause of the dismal Convulsions we have
here lately fallen into; Supposing that his Books
of <i>Memorable Providences</i>, relating to Witchcraft,
as also his <i>Wonders of the Invisible World</i>, did
contain in them things not warrantable, and very
dangerous, I sent to him a Letter of Quotations
out of those Books, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>That so, if it might have been, I might understand
what tollerable Sense he would put upon
his own words, which I took to be a better
way of Proceeding, than to have affixed what I
thought to be their natural consequences, and lest
I might be Judged a Sceptic I gave him a full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
and free account of my belief relating to those
Doctrines, together with the grounds thereof;
And prayed him that if I err'd I might be shewed
it by Scripture, and this I had his reiterated promise
for. But after more than a Years waiting for the
performance thereof, all that is done in compliance
therewith, is that in <i>Feb.</i> last, he sent me
four sheets of his writing as his belief, but before
I might receive it I must engage to deliver it back
in a Fortnight and not Copy'd.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> A Summary
account [34] of which I shall give you, when I
have first acquainted you what the Doctrines were
which I sent to him for his concurrence with, or
confutation of, and to which I had his promise,
as above.</p>

<p>These by way of Question, (<i>Viz.</i>) whether that
fourth Head cited and recommended by himself
(In <i>Wonders of the Invisible World</i>, of Mr. <i>Gauls</i>)
ought to be believed as a truth, which runs thus;
Among the most unhappy circumstances to Convict
a Witch, one is a Maligning and Oppugning
the Word, Work, and Worship of God, and
seeking by any Extraordinary sign to seduce any
from it, <i>Deut.</i> xiii. 1, 2. <i>Mat.</i> xxiv. 24. <i>Acts</i>
xiii. 8, 10. 2 <i>Tim.</i> iii. 8. do but mark well the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>places, and for this very property of thus oppugning
and perverting, they are all there concluded
arrant and absolute Witches.</p>

<p>And if in Witchcraft the Devil by means of a
Witch does the Mischief, how 'tis possible to
distinguish it from Possession, both being said to
be performed by the Devil, and yet without an
Infallible distinction there can be no certainty in
Judgment. And whether it can be proved that
the <i>Jewish</i> Church in any Age before, or in our
Saviours time, even in the time of their greatest
Apostacy did believe that a Witch had power to
Commissionate Devils to do Mischief.</p>

<p>So much to the Questions. These were sent
as my belief: That the devils bounds are sett,
that he cant pass; That the devils are so full of
Malice, that it cant be added to by Mankind;
That where he hath power he neither can nor
will omit executing it; That 'tis only the Almighty
that sets bounds to his rage, and that only
can Commissionate him to hurt or destroy. And
now I shall give you the Summary account of his
four sheets above mentioned, as near as memory
could recollect, in Ten Particulars.</p>

<p>1. That the Devils have in their Natures a
power to work Wonders and Miracles; particularly
that the <i>Pharisees</i> were not mistaken in
asserting that the Devils might be cast out by
<i>Beelzebub</i>; and that our Saviours Answer does not
oppose that assertion; and that he hath the Power
of Death, that he can make the most Solid things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
Invisible; and can Invisibly bring poyson and
force it down Peoples Throats.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>2. That to assert this Natural, wonderful Power
of the Devil, makes most for the Glory of God,
in preserving Man from its effects,</p>

<p>3. Yet this Power is restrained by the Almighty,
as pleaseth him.</p>

<p>4. That a Witch is one that makes a Covenant
with the Devil.</p>

<p>5. That by vertue of such a Covenant, she arrives
at a Power to Commissionate him.</p>

<p>6. That God has ordain'd, that when the Devil
is call'd upon by the Witch, tho' he were before
restrained by the Almighty, the desired mischiefs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
ordinarily shall as certainly be performed, as if
the Witch had [35] lodged poyson in the Bowels
of her Neighbour, or had set Mastiff Dogs on
them.</p>

<p>7. That the Witche's Art of applying the
<i>Plastic Spirit of the World</i> to unlawful purposes,
does Naturally contribute to the mischiefs done
by the Devil.</p>

<p>8. That that God which restrain'd an <i>Abimelich</i>
and a <i>Laban</i> from hurting, does also restrain
the Witch from Calling upon or Improving the
Devil, when he will not have his Power so exerted.</p>

<p>9. That to have a Familiar Spirit, is to be able
to cause a Devil to take bodily shapes, whereby
either to give responses, or to receive orders for
doing mischief.</p>

<p>10. That this is the Judgment of most of the
Divines in the Countrey, whether <i>English</i>, <i>Dutch
or French</i>.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
This as I said, I took to be most material in
the four sheets sent to me as his belief, and is also
all the performance he has yet made of his several
promises; which ten Articles being done only
by memory, lest thro' mistake or want of the
Original, I might have committed any errors, I
sent them to him that, if there were any, they
might be rectified: But instead of such an Answer,
as might be expected from a Minister and
a learn'd Gentleman, one Mr. <i>W&mdash;&mdash;</i> shewed me a
Letter writ by Mr. <i>C. M&mdash;&mdash;</i> to himself, which I
might read, but neither borrow nor Copy, and
so, if I were minded, could give but a short account
of it.</p>

<p>And passing over his hard Language, which,
as I am conscious to myself; I never deserv'd,
(relating to my writing in the margin of the
four sheets; and to these ten Articles) so I hope
I understand my Duty, better than to imitate
him in retorting the like. Among his many
words in his said Letters, I meet with two small
Objections; one is against the word (<i>Miracle</i>) in
the first Article, the word, I say, not the matter,
for the works he attributes to the Devil are the
same in their being above or against the Course
of Nature and all Natural causes, yet he will not
admit of these to be call'd Miracles. And hence
he reckon's it the greatest difficulty he meets
with in this whole affair, to distinguish the works
of the Devil from Miracles. And hence also he
concedes to the Devil the Power to make the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
most Solid things Invisible, and Invisibly to bring
Poyson and force it down Peoples Throats, <i>&amp;c.</i>
Which I look upon to be as true Miracles as
that. 2 <i>Kings</i> vi. 18. and this is the sense I
understand the word in, and in this sense, he
himself in the four sheets admits it; for he has
an objection to this effect, <i>Viz.</i> [If the Devils
have such power, <i>&amp;c.</i> then miracles are not
ceas'd; and where are we then? (his Answer is)
Where! even just where we were before, say I]
so that it seems the only offence here is at my
using his words. His second objection (for
weight) is against the whole ninth Article, and
wonders [36] how 'tis possible for one Man so
much to misunderstand another; Yet as I remember,
he speaking of the Witch of <i>Endor</i> in
the said four sheets says, she had a familiar Spirit,
and that [a Spirit belonging to the Invisible
World, upon her calling appear'd to <i>Saul</i>] <i>&amp;c.</i>
and if so 'tis certain he gave responses, he also
tells of <i>Balaam</i>, that it was known that he could
set Devils on People to destroy them, and therefore
how this objection should bear any Force I
see not; The rest of the objections are of so
small weight that once reading may be sufficient
to clear them up, and if this be not so, he can,
when he pleases, by making it Publick together
with the Margins I writ, Convince all People of
the truth of what he asserts; But here 'tis to be
noted, that the 2<i>d.</i> 3<i>rd.</i> 4<i>th.</i> and 5<i>th</i> Articles he
concedes to, as having nothing to object against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
them, but that they are his belief; and that the
6<i>th.</i> and 7<i>th.</i> he puts for Answer to an objection
which he thus frames, <i>Viz.</i> If the Devil have
such powers but cannot exert them but by permission
from God, what can the Witch contribute
thereto. And thus I have faithfully
performed what I undertook, and do solemnly
declare, I have not intentionally in the least
wronged the Gentleman concern'd, nor design'd
the least blemish to his Reputation; but if it
stands in competition with the Glory of God,
the only Almighty Being, his truths and his
Peoples welfare, I suppose these too valuable to
be trampled on for his sake, tho' in other things
I am ready to my power (tho' with denying some
part of my own interest) to serve him. Had
this Gentleman declin'd or detracted his four
sheets, I see not but he might have done it, and
which I think there was cause enough for him
to have done, but to own the four sheets, and at
the same time to disown the Doctrine contain'd
in them, and this knowing that I have no Copy,
renders the whole of the worse aspect.</p>

<p>And now I shall give you a further account of
my Belief, when I have first premised, that 'tis a
prevailing Belief in this Countrey, and elsewhere,
that the Scriptures are not full in the Description
of, and in the way and means how to detect a
Witch, tho' positive in their Punishment to be
by Death; and that hence they have thought
themselves under a necessity of taking up with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
the Sentiments of such Men or Places that are
thought worthy to give rules to detect them by:
And have accordingly practised, <i>viz.</i> In searching
for Tets for the Devil to suck; Trying whether
the suspected can say the Lords Prayer; And
whether the Afflicted falls at the sight, and rises
at the touch of the supposed Witch; As also by
the Afflicted or Possessed giving account who is
the Witch.</p>

<p>Touching these my belief is, that 'tis highly
Derogatory to the wisdom of the Wise Lawgiver,
to ascert, That he has given a Law by <i>Moses</i>, the
Penalty whereof is Death; and yet no direction to
his People, whereby to know and detect the culpable,
till our <i>Triumvirate</i> Mr. [37] <i>Perkins</i>, <i>Gaul</i>
and <i>Bernard</i>, had given us their receits, and that
that fourth Head of Mr. <i>Gauls</i>, being so well
prov'd by Scripture is a truth, and contains a full
and clear Testimony, who are Witches culpable
of Death, and that plainly and from Scripture,
yet not excluding any other branch, when as
well proved by that infallible rule. And that
the going to the Afflicted or Possessed, to have
them Divine who are Witches by their Specteral
sight, is a great wickedness, even the Sin of <i>Saul</i>
(for which he also Died) but with this difference,
the one did it for Augury, or to know future
Events, the other in order to take away Life;
and that the searching for Tets, the experiment
of their saying the Lords Prayer; the falling at
the sight and rising at the touch of the supposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
Criminal, being all of them foreign from Scripture,
as well as reason, are abominations to be
abhor'd and repented of. And that our <i>Salem</i>
Witchcraft, either respecting the Judges and Juries,
their tenderness of Life, or the Multitude
and pertinency of witnesses, both Afflicted and
Confessors, or the Integrity of the Historians,
are as Authentic, and made as certain as any ever
of that kind in the World; and yet who is it
that now sees not through it, and that these were
the Sentiments that have procured the sorest
Affliction, and most lasting infamy that ever
befel this Country, and most like so to do again,
if the same notions be still entertain'd and finally
that these are those last times, of which the Spirit
speaks expressly, <i>Tim.</i> iv. 1. <i>And now ye that
are Fathers in the Churches, Guides to the People,
and the Salt of the Earth</i>.</p>

<p>I beseech you consider these things; and if you
find the Glory of God diminisht by ascribing
such power to Witches and Devils; His truths
oppos'd by these notions; and his People aspersed
in their Doctrines and Reputations, and indangered
in their Lives; I dare not dictate to you,
you know your duty as Watchmen, and the Lord
be with you.</p>

<p>But if you find my belief contrary to sound
Doctrine, I intreat you to shew it me by the
Scripture; And in the mean time blame me not
if I cannot believe that there are several Almighties;
for to do all sorts of wonders, beyond
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
and above the Course of Nature, is certainly the
work of <i>Omnipotency</i>. So also, he that shall
Commissionate or Impower to these, must also
be Almighty; and I think it not a sufficient
<i>salvo</i>, to say they may be restrain'd by the most
High; and hope you will not put any hard Construction
on these my Endeavours to get information
(all other ways failing) in things so needful
to be known; praying the Almightys Guidance
and protection, I am</p>

<p class="in4">Mr. <i>Samuel Willard</i>.</p>

<p><i>Reverend Sir</i>,</p>

<p class="dropcap">MY former of <i>March</i> the 18th. directed to
the Ministers (and which was lodg'd with
yourself) containing several Articles, which I
sent as my belief, praying them if I erred to
shew it me by Scripture, I have as yet had no
Answer to, either by word or writing, which
makes me gather that they are approved of as
<i>Orthodox</i>, or at least that they have such Foundations,
as that none are willing to manifest any
opposition to them: And therefore with submission,
<i>&amp;c</i>. I think that that late seasonable and
well-design'd Dialogue intituled, <i>Some miscellany
Observations,</i><a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
<i>&amp;c.</i> of which yourself is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
suppos'd Author (and which was so serviceable in
the time of it) is yet liable to a male construction,
even to the endangering to revive what it most
opposes, and to bring those practices again on
Foot, which in the day thereof were so terrible
to this whole Countrey: The words which I
suppose so liable to Misconstruction, are <i>pag.</i> 14.
B. <i>Who informed them?</i> S. <i>the Spectre</i>. B. <i>very
good, and that's the Devil turned Informer. How
are good Men like to fare against whom he hath
particular Malice</i>!</p>

<p><i>It is but a Presumption, and Wise Men will weigh
Presumptions against Presumptions. There is to be
no Examination without grounds of Suspicion. Some
Persons Credit ought to be accounted too good to be
undermined so far as to be suspected on so <span class="errauthor" title="read: slight">flight</span> a
ground: and it is an Injury done them to bring
them upon Examination, which renders them openly
Suspected. I will not deny but for Persons already
suspected and of Ill fame, it may occasion their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>being examin'd</i>. In which these words ('tis but a
presumption, <i>&amp;c.</i>) (and some Persons credit, <i>&amp;c.</i>)
(and I will not deny but for Persons already suspected,
<i>&amp;c.</i>) this I take to be waving to discuss
those points, the speaking to which might at that
time have hindered the usefulness and success of
that Book, rather than any declaring the Sentiments
of the Author. But notwithstanding many
Persons will be ready to understand this, as if the
Author did wholly leave it with the Justice, to
Judge who are Ill Persons, such as the Devils
Accusations may fasten upon; And that the Devils
Accusation of a Person, is a Presumption against
them of their guilt; and that upon such presumptions,
they may be had to Examination, if the
Justice counts them Persons of ill fame (for the
Author I suppose knows that the bear Examination
will leave such a stain upon them, and well
if their Posterity escape it!) as the length of a
Holy and unblameable Life will be found too
short to Extirpate. And if the Justice may go
thus far with the Devils Evidence, then the addition
of a story or two of some Cart overset, or
person taken Sick after a quarrel, might as well
be thought sufficient for their Commitment, in
order to [39] their Tryal as 'tis call'd (tho' this
too often has been more like a Stage Play, or a
<i>Tragicomical Scene</i>) and so that other ways useful
Book, may prove the greatest Snare to revive the
same practices again.</p>

<p>These things being so liable, as I said, to such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
male-construction, it were needful that Men
might be undeceiv'd, and the matter more fully
demonstrated, (<i>Viz.</i>) That the Devils Accusation
is not so much as any presumption against the
Life or Reputation of any person, for how are
good Men like to fare, if his malicious accusations
may be taken as a presumption of their
Guilt; and that his accusations as they are no
presumption against persons of unspotted Fame,
so neither are to be heard, or any ways regarded
against persons tho' otherways of ill Life, much
less for their having long since had their Names
abused by his outcries, or by the Malice of Ill
Neighbours; and that Justice knows no difference
of Persons; that if this Evidence be sufficient to
bring one person 'tis so to bring any other to
Examination, and consequently to the utmost
extent of odium, which such Examination will
certainly expose them to, for who can know any
other, but that as the one may be Maliciously
accused by Devils and a Devilish report gone before
it; so that another who has not been so
much as accused before, being more Cunning or
more seeming Religious, might yet be more
guilty; the whole depending upon Invisible Evidence,
of which Invisible stuff, tho' we have had
more than sufficient, yet I find (among other
Reverend Persons) your Names to a certain Printed
Paper, which runs thus.</p>

<big>Certain Proposals<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> <i>made by the President
and Fellows of</i> Harvard College, <i>to the
Reverend Ministers of the Gospel, in the
several Churches of</i> New-England.</big></p>

<p class="dropcap">F<i>irst.</i> <i>To observe and record the more Illustrious
Discoveries of the Divine Providence in the
Government of the World, is a design so holy, so
useful, so justly approved, that the too general neglect
of it in the Churches of God, is as justly to be Lamented.</i></p>

<p>2. <i>For the redress of that neglect, altho' all
Christians have a Duty incumbent on them, yet it is
in a peculiar manner to be recommended unto the
Ministers of the</i> Gospel, <i>to improve the special advantages
which are in their Hands, to obtain and
preserve the knowledge of such notable occurrences
as are sought out by all that have pleasure in the
great Works of the Lord.</i></p>

<p>3. <i>The things to be esteemed Memorable, are specially
all unusual accidents in the Heaven, or Earth,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>or Water, All wonderful Deliverances of the Distressed,
Mercies to the Godly, Judgments on the
Wicked, and more Glorious fulfilments of either the
Promises or Threatnings in the Scriptures of Truth,
with Apparitions, Possessions, Enchantments, and all
extraordinary things, wherein the Existence and
Agency of the Invisible World is more sensibly demonstrated.</i></p>

<p>[40] 4. <i>It is therefore Proposed, That the Ministers
throughout this Land, would manifest their
regards unto the Works of the Lord, and the Opperation
of his hands, by reviving their cares to take
Written Accounts of such</i> Remarkables: <i>But still
well Attested with credibled and sufficient Witness.</i></p>

<p>5. <i>It is desired that the Accounts, thus taken of
these Remarkables, may be sent in unto the</i> President,<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
<i>or the Fellows of the Colledge, by whome they shall be

<p class="p2">Here being an Encouragement to all good
Men, to send in such remarkables as are therein
expressed, I have sent the following, not that I
think them a more sensible demonstration of the
being of a future State (with Rewards and Punishments)
or of Angels good and bad, <i>&amp;c.</i> than
the Scriptures of truth hold forth, <i>&amp;c.</i> Or than
any of those other demonstrations God hath given
us; for this were Treacherously and Perfidiously
to quit the Post to the Enemy, the <i>Sadducee, Deist,</i>
and <i>Atheist</i> would hereby be put in a condition
so Triumphantly to deny the Existence and
Agency thereof. As that a few Stories told
(which at best must be owned to be fallible and
liable to misrepresentations) could not be thought
Infallibly sufficient to demonstrate the truth
against them. I have heard that in Logick a
false Argument is reckon'd much worse than
none: Yet supposing that a Collection of In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>stances
may be many ways useful, not only to the
present but succeeding Ages, I have sent you the
following remarkables, which have lately occurred,
the certainty of which, if any scruple it, will be
found no hard matter to get satisfaction therein:
But here, not to insist on those less occurrents, as
the sudden Death of one of our late Justices,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
and a like Mortallity that fell upon the two Sons
of another of them, with the Fall of a Man that
was making provision to raise the New Northern
Bell, which, when it was up, the first person,
whose death it was to signifie, was said to be a
Child of him, who by Printing and speaking,
had had as great hand in procur[41]ing the late
Actions as any, if not the greatest; and the Splitting
the Gun at <i>Salem</i>, where that furious Marshal,
and his Father, <i>&amp;c.</i> was rent to pieces,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> <i>&amp;c.</i>
As to all these it must be owned, that no man
knows love or hatred by all that is before him,
much less can they be more sensible demonstrations
of the Existence or Agency of the <i>Invisible
World</i>, than the scriptures of Truth afford, <i>&amp;c.</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>tho' the Rich Man in the Parable might think
otherwise, <i>&amp;c.</i> who was seeking to send some
more sensible Demonstrations thereof to his
Brethren, <i>&amp;c.</i> In that Tremendous Judgment
of God upon this Countrey, by the late amazing
Prosecution of the People here, under the Notion
of Witches; whereby 20 Suffered as Evil doers
(besides those that died in Prison) about ten more
Condemned, and a hundred Imprisoned, and
about two hundred more Accused, and the Countrey
generally in fears, when it would come to
their turn to be Accused; and the Prosecution and
manner of Tryal such, that most would have chosen
to have fallen into the hands of the Barbarous
Enemy, rather than (under that notion) into
the hands of their Brethren in Church Fellowship;
and in short, was such an Affliction as far
exceeded all that ever this Countrey hath laboured
under.</p>

<p>Yet in this Mount, God is seen; when it was
thus bad with this distressed People, a full and a
sudden stop is put, not only without, but against
the Inclination of many, for out of the Eater
came forth Meat: Those very Accusers which
had been improved as Witnesses against so many,
by the Providence of the most High, and perhaps
blinded with Malice, are left to accuse those in
most High esteem, both Magistrates and Ministers,
as guilty of Witchcraft, which shewed our
Rulers, that necessity lay upon them, to confound
that which had so long confounded the Countrey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
as being unwilling themselves to run the same
Risque, this that was in the Event of it to this
Countrey, as Life from the Dead, is most easie
with him, in whose Hands are the Hearts of all
Men, and was a very signal deliverance to this
whole Countrey. No less Observable was it, that
tho' at the time when the Devils Testimony, by
the Afflicted, was first laid aside, there were great
Numbers of (real or pretended) Afflicted: Yet
when this was once not Judged of Validity
enough to be any longer brought into the Court
against the Accused as Evidence, the Affliction
generally ceased, and only some remainders of it
in such places, where more Encouragement was
given to the Actors, God seeming thereby plainly
to Decipher that Sin of going to the Devil, <i>&amp;c.</i>
as the rise and foundation of those Punishments.</p>

<p>And thus, Reverend Sir, I have, as I understand
it, performed my Duty herein, for the
Glory of God, and the well-being of Men.
And for my Freedome used in this, and former
Writings, relating to the Actors in this Tragedy,
I shall not Apologize, but give you the words
of one to [42] whom some can afford the
title of Venerable (when he is arguing for that
which they have undertaken to ascert, tho' at
other times, more Diminutive Epithete, must
serve) it is the Reverend Mr. R. <i>Baxter</i> in his
Book, <i>the Cure of Church Divisions</i>, p. 257, 258.
<i>But</i> (I pray you mark it) <i>the way of God is to
shame the Sinner, how good soever in other respects,</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
<i>That the sin may have the greater shame, and Religion
may not be shamed, as if it allowed men to sin;
Nor God the Author of Religion be Dishonoured;
Nor others be without the Warning; But the way
of the Devil is, to hide or justifie the sin, as if it
were for fear of Disparaging the goodness of the
Persons that committed it; that so he may hereby
Dishonour Religion and Godliness itself, and make
men believe it is but a Cover for any Wickedness,
and as consistent with it, as a looser Life is, and
that he may keep the Sinner from Repenting, and
blot out the Memory of that warning, which should
have preserved After-Ages from the like falls.
Scripture shameth the Professors</i>, (<i>tho' a</i> David, <i>a</i>
Solomon, Peter, Noah, <i>or</i> Lot) <i>that the Religion
profest may not be shamed but vindicated: Satan
would preserve the Honour of Professors, that the
Religion professed may bear the shame; and so it may
fall on God himself</i>.</p>

<p>And now that all that have had a hand in any
horrid and bloody practices may be brought to
give glory to God, and take the due shame to
themselves; and that our Watchmen may no
longer seek to palliate (much less give thanks for)
such, <i>&amp;c.</i> (thereby making them their own) and
that the people may no longer perish for want of
knowledge in the midst of such means of light;
Nor God be any longer dishonoured by false sentiments
in these matters, is the earnest desire and
prayer of, Sir, yours to my power.</p>

<p class="dropcap">HAVING long since sent you some doctrinals
as to my belief, together with my request
to you, that if I erred you would be pleased to
shew it me by scripture, <i>viz.</i> That the Devils
bounds are set which he cannot pass; That the
Devils are so full of malice that it cannot be added
to by mankind; That where he hath power he
neither can nor will omit executing it; That 'tis
only the Almighty that sets bounds to his rage,
and that only can commissionate him to hurt and
destroy, <i>&amp;c.</i> But instead of such an Answer as
was promised, and justly expected, you were
pleased to send me a Book, which you since call'd
an ungainsayable one; which Book till lately I
have not had opportunity so fully to consider.
And to the end you may see I have now done it,
I have sent to you some of the remarkables contained
in the said Book, Intituled,</p>

<p class="hang">[<a id="a43a"></a>43] <big><i>The Certainty of the World of Spirits,
written by Mr.</i> R. B.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> London,
<i>Printed</i>. 1691.</big></p>

<p class="dropcap">IT <i>is therein conceded</i> (Preface) That to see Devils
and Spirits ordinarily would not be enough to
convince Atheists. Page 88. Atheists are not to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>be convinced by stories, their own senses are not
enough to convince them any more than sense
will convince a Papist from Transubstantiation.
(<i>D. Laderd.</i>) P. 4. No Spirit can do any thing
but by God's will and permission. (<i>Preface</i>) 'Tis
the free will of Man that gives the Devils their
hurting power: And without our own consent
they cannot hurt us. (<i>It is asserted.</i> P. 222, 223,)
That it is a perverse opposition of Popery which
causes many Protestants not to regard the benefits
we receive by Angels. And Ministers are faulty,
that do not pray and give thanks to God for their
Ministry; and that neglect to teach Believers,
what love and what thanks they owe to Angels.
P. 225. Most good people look so much to God
and to Ministers, that they take little notice of
Angels, which are God's great Ministers. P. 234.
The Author dares not, as some have done, judge
the Catholick Church to become Anti-Christian
Idolaters, as soon as they gave too much Worship
to Saints and Angels. P. 7. The Blessed Souls
shall be like the Angels, therefore may appear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>here, P. 3, 4. 'Tis hard to know whether it be
a Devil or a human Soul that appears, or whether
the Soul of a good or a bad person. P. 61. or the
Soul of some dead friend that suffers, and yet
retains love, <i>&amp;c.</i> P. 222. No doubt the Souls of
the wicked carry with them their former inclinations
of Covetousness, Revenge, <i>&amp;c.</i> P. 7. When
Revengeful things are done, as on Murderers, Defrauders,
<i>&amp;c.</i> it seems to be from the revengeful
wrath of some bad Soul, if it be about Money or
Lands, then from a Worldly minded one; some
significations of God's mercy to wicked Souls
after this Life. P. 4. 'Tis a doubt whether besides
the Angels (good and bad) and the Souls of
men, there is not a third sort, call'd Faries and
Goblins. It is unsearchable to us how far God
leaves Spirits to freewill in small things, suspending
his predetermining motion.</p>

<p>P. 246. The Devils have a Marvellous power,
if but a silly wretched Witch consent. P. 10.
202. The stories of Witches and Spirits are many
ways useful, particularly to convince Atheists, and
confirm Believers, and to prove the Operation of
Spirits. P. 232. To help men to understand that
Devils make no small number of Laws, and Rulers
in the World, and are Authors of most of the
Wars, and of many Sermons, and of Books that
adorn the Liberaries of learned men. P. 6. 102.
The Devil's lying with the Witch is not to be
denied, and is more to Exercise the Lust of the
Witch than of the Devil, who can also bring in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
another Witch with[44]out opening the door,
and so perform it by one Witch with another.
P. 105. Witches can raise Storms, sell Winds, <i>&amp;c.</i>
as is commonly affirmed. P. 107. In <i>America</i>
'tis a common thing to see Spirits day and night.
P. 95, 96, 97, 110. Stories of a Child that could
not be cured of Witchcraft, because the <i><span class="err" title="original: Emher">Ember</span></i><a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>-weeks
were past, Vomited a Knife a span long,
Cart Nails, <i>&amp;c.</i> neither eat nor drank fifteen days
and nights together; a long piece of Wood, four
Knives, and two sharp pieces of Iron, ev'ry one
above a span long, taken out of the Stomach, <i>&amp;c.</i>
Hair, Stones, Bones, Vomited, <i>&amp;c.</i> 1000 l. of
Blood lost by one person in a years time.</p>

<p>P. 250. A story that makes the Author think
it possible that such great things (as he mentions)
should be gotten down and up Peoples Throats.</p>

<p>P. 164. Partial credibility spoils many a good
story.</p>

<p>P. 125. The Devil's substance enters into the

<p>In this, Sir, I suppose that if I have not wronged
the sense of the Author in the places quoted
(which I trust you shall not find I have done) I
can't be thought accountable for the Errors or
Contradictions to himself or to the truth, if any
such be found, particularly what he grants in the
Preface (of the freewill of Man, giving the Devil
his hurting power.) This being not only more
than those call'd Witch-Advocates would desire to
be conceded to them: But is a palpable and manifest
overturning the Authors design in all his
Witch stories. For who would consent to have
the Devil afflict himself? As also his concession
[that no Spirit can do any thing but by God's
will and permission,] I cannot perswade myself
but you must be sensible of their apparent contradictoriness
to the rest. Others there are of a
very ill aspect, as <i>p.</i> 234. the Catholicks are much
encouraged in their Adoration of Angels and
Saints. If that were so Innocent as not to render
them Anti-christian Idolaters; and that <i>p.</i> 4. if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
admitted, will seem to lay an ungainsayable foundation
for the <i>Pagan</i>, <i>Indian</i>, and <i>Diabolists</i> Faith;
by telling us it is beyond our search to know how
far God leaves the Devils to free-will, to do what
they please, in this World, with a suspension of
God's Predetermination; which if it [45] were
a truth, what were more rational than to oblige
him that has such power over us. The Atheists
also would take encouragement if it were granted
that we cannot know how far God suspends his
predetermining motion, he would thence affirm,
we as little know that there is a predetermining
motion, and consequently whether there be a
God, and <i>p.</i> 165. would abundantly strengthen
them, when such a Learned, experienced, and
highly esteemed Christian shall own that he
knows not who 'tis that governs the Thunderstorms;
for it might as well discover ignorance,
who 'tis that disposes of Earthquakes, Gun-shot,
and afflictions that befall any, with the rest of
Mundane Events. I design not to remark all that
in the Book is remarkable, such as the departed
Souls wandering again hither to put men upon
revenge, <i>&amp;c.</i> savouring so much of <i>Pithagoras</i>
his Transmigration of Souls, and the Separation
of the Soul from the Body without death, as in
the case of her that went to see her Children,
while yet she did not stir out of her Bed, which
seems to be a new speculation; unless it determins
in favour of Transubstantiation, that a Body may
be at the same time in several places. Upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
whole it is ungainsayable, That that Book, though
so highly extol'd, may be justly expected to occasion
the staggering of the weak, and the hardening
of unbelievers in their Infidelity. And it
seems amazing, that you should not only give it
such a recommend, but that you should send it to
me, in order (as I take it) to pervert me from the
belief of those fundamental Doctrinals (above recited)
Though I account them more firm than
Heaven and Earth. But that which is yet more
strange to me, is that Mr. <i>B</i> his Friends did not
advise him better, than in his declined Age to
emit such crude matter to the public. As to the
sometime Reverend Author, let his works praise
the Remembrance of him; but for such as are
either Erroneous and foisted upon him, or the
effect of an aged Imbecillity, let them be detected
that they may proceed no further.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>I am not ignorant that the manner of Education
of Youth in, I think, almost all Christian
Schools hath a natural tendency to propagate
those Doctrines of Devils heretofore (solely) profest
among <i>Ethnicks</i>,<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> and particularly in matters
of Witchcraft, <i>&amp;c.</i> For notwithstanding the
Council of <i>Carthage</i> their taking notice that the
Christian Doctors did converse much with the
writings of the Heathens for the gaining of Eloquence,
forbad the reading of the Books of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span><i>Gentiles</i>; yet it seems this was only a Bill without
a penalty, which their successors did not look
upon to be binding. He that should in this age
take a view of the Schools, might be induced to
believe that the ages since have thought, that
without such Heathen Learning a man cannot be
so accomplish'd, as to have any pretence to Academick
Literature: and that the vulgar might
not be without the benefit of such Learning,
some of their Dis[46]ciples have taught them to
speak <i>English</i>, which has given me the opportunity

<p>These Fables of the Heathens (tho' in themselves
of no more validity than the idle Tales of
an <i>Indian</i>, or the Discourses of a known Romancer)
are become the School-learning, not to say
the Faith of Christians, and are the Scriptures
brought (instead of that most sure Word) if not
to prove Doctrine, yet as illustrations thereof.

Remarkable Providences <i>pag.</i> 250. (This perhaps
might be the cause that in <i>England</i> a people
otherways sober and Religious) have for some Ages
(in a manner wholly) refused admitting those so
educated to the work of the Ministry. Such
education and practice, have so far prevailed that
it has been a means of corrupting the Christian
world, almost to that degree as to be ungainsayable;
for tho' there is Reason to hope that these
Diabolical principles have not so prevail'd (with
multitudes of Christians) as that they ascribe to a
Witch and a Devil the Attributes peculiar to the
Almighty; yet how few are willing to be found
opposing such a torrent, as knowing that in so
doing they shall be sure to meet with opposition
to the utmost, from the many, both of Magistrates,
Ministers and People; and the name of
<i>Sadducee</i>, <i>Atheist</i>, and perhaps Witch too cast
upon them most liberally, by men of the highest
profession in Godliness. And if not so learned
as some of themselves, then accounted only fit to
be trampled on, and their Arguments (tho both
Rational and Scriptural) as fit only for contempt.
But tho this be the deplorable Dilemma; yet
some have dared from time to time (for the glory
of God, and the good and safety of Mens lives,
<i>&amp;c.</i>) to run all these Risques. And that God
who has said, <i>My glory I will not give to another</i>,
is able to protect those that are found doing their
duty herein against all opposers; and however
other ways contemptible can make them useful
in his own hand, who has sometimes chosen the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
weakest Instruments, that his power may be the
more Illustrious.</p>

<p><i>And now, Reverend Sir, if you are conscious to
yourself, that you have in your principles, or practices
been abetting to such grand Errors, I cannot see
how it can consist with sincerity to be so convinc'd in
matters so nearly relating to the glory of God, and
lives of Innocents; and at the same time so much to
fear disparagement among Men, as to stifle Conscience,
and dissemble an approving of former sentiments;
you know that word</i>, he that honoureth me
I will honour, and he that despiseth me shall be
lightly esteemed. <i>But if you think that in these
matters you have done your duty, and taught people
theirs; and that the Doctrines cited from the mentioned</i>
[<a id="a48a"></a>48] <i>Book are ungainsayable: I shall conclude
in almost his words, He that teaches such Doctrine,
if through Ignorance he believes not what he
saith, may be a Christian: But if he believes them, he
is in the broad path to Heathenism, Devilism, Popery
or Atheism. It is a solemn caution, Gal.</i> i. 8. But
tho we or an Angel from Heaven preach any
other Gospel unto you than that which we have
preached unto you, let him be accursed. <i>I hope

<p class="dropcap">CHRISTIANITY <i>had been but a short time
in the World, when there was raised against
it, not only open profest Enemies; but secret and
imbred underminers, who sought thereby to effect
that which open force had been so often baffled in</i>.</p>

<p><i>And notwithstanding that primitive purity and
sincerity, which in some good measure was still retained;
yet the cunning deceivers and Apostate Hereticks
found opportunity to beguile the unwary, and
this in fundamentals.</i></p>

<p><i>Among others which then sprung up, with but too
much advantage in the third Century, the</i> Maniche<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
<i>did spread his Pestiferous sentiments, and
taught the Existence of two Beings, or Causes of all
things, viz. a good and a bad: but these were soon
silenced by the more Orthodox Doctors, and Anathematized
by General Councels. And at this day the
American Indians, another sort of</i> Maniche, <i>entertaining</i>
(<i>thus far</i>) <i>the same belief, hold it their prudence
and interest to please that evil Being, as well
by perpetrating other Murders, as by their Bloody
Sacrifices, that so he may not harm them. The Iron
teeth of time have now almost devoured the name of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>the former, and as to the latter,
it is to <span class="err" title="original: he">be</span> hoped that

<p><i>And as those primitive times, were not priviledged
against the spreading of dangerous Heresie, so neither
can any now pretend to any such Immunity, tho'
professing the enjoyment of a primitive purity.</i></p>

<p><i>Might a Judgment be made from the Books of
the modern learned Divines, or from the practice of
Courts, or from the Faith of many, who call themselves
Christians, it might be modestly, tho' sadly concluded,
that the Doctrine of the</i> Maniche, <i>at least
great part of it, is so far from being forgotten that
'tis almost every where profest. We in these ends of
the Earth need not seek far for Instances, in each
respect to demonstrate this. The Books here Printed,
and recommended not only by the respective Authors,
but by many of their Brethren, do set forth that the

<p><i>These places with a multitude more, do abundantly
testifie that the Assertors of such power to be in the
evil Being, do speak in a dialect different from the
scriptures,</i> (<i>laying a firm foundation for the Indians
adorations, which agrees well with what</i> A. Ross<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
<i>sets forth, in his Mistag. Poetic</i>, p. 116, <i>that their
ancients did Usurp the furies and their God</i> Averinci,
<i>that they might forbear to hurt them</i>.)</p>

<p><i>And have not the Courts in some parts of the
World by their practice testified their concurrence
with such belief, prosecuting to Death many people
upon that notion, of their improving such power of
the Evil one, to the raising of Storms; afflicting and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
killing of others, tho at great distance from them;
doing things in their own persons above humane
strength, destroying of Cattle, flying in the Air,
turning themselves into Cats or Dogs, &amp;c. Which
by the way must needs imply some thing of goodness
to be in that evil Being, who, tho he has such power,
would not exert it, were it not for this people, or else
that they can some way add to this mighty power.</i><a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p><i>And are the people a whit behind in their beliefs?
is there any thing</i> (<i>abovementioned,</i>) <i>their strong Faith
looks upon to be too hard for this evil Being to effect?</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Here it will be answered, God permits it. Which
answer is so far an owning the Doctrine, that the
Devil has in his nature a power to do all these
things, and can exert this power, except when he is
restrained, which is in effect to say that God has
made Nature to fight against itself. That he has
made a Creature, who has it in the power of his
Nature to overthrow Nature, and to act above and</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
<i>
against it. Which he that can believe may as well
believe the greatest contradiction. That Being which
can do this in the smallest thing, can do it in the
greatest. If</i> Moses <i>with a bare permission might
stretch forth his Rod, yet he was not able to bring
Plagues upon the</i> Egyptians, <i>or to divide the Waters,
without a Commission from the most high; so neither
can that evil Being perform any of this without a
Commission from the same power. The Scripture
recites more Miracles wrought by Men than by
Angels good and bad; Tho this Doctrine be so dishonourable
to the only Almighty Being, as to ascribe
such Attributes to the Evil one, as are the Incommunicable
prerogative of him, who is the alone
Sovereign Being; yet here is not all: But as he
that Steers by a false Compass, the further he Sails
the more he is out of his way; so though there is in
some things a variation</i> [50] <i>from, there is in others
a further progression in, or building upon the said
Doctrine of the Maniche</i>.</p>

<p><i>Men in this Age are not content barely to believe
such an exorbitant power to be in the nature of this
evil Being; but have imagined that he prevails with
many to sign a Book, or make a contract with him,
whereby they are inabled to perform all the things
abovementioned. Another Account is given hereof,
viz. that by vertue of such a Covenant they attain
power to Commissionate him. And though the two
parties are not agreed which to put it upon, whether
the Devil impowers the Witch, or the Witch
commissionate him; yet both parties are agreed in</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
<i>this, That one way or other the mischief is effected,
and so the Criminal becomes culpable of Death. In
the search after such a sort of Criminals, how many
Countries have fallen into such Convulsions. That
the Devastations made by a Conquering Enemy, nor
the Plague itself, has not been so formidable.</i></p>

<p>That not only good persons have thus been
blemish'd in their Reputations, but much innocent
Blood hath been shed, is testified even by
those very Books, Cases of Conscience, <i>p.</i> 33.
Remarkable provid. <i>p.</i> 179. Memor. provid.
<i>p.</i> 28.</p>

<p>And (to add) what less can be expected, when
Men having taken up such a belief, of a covenanting,
afflicting and killing Witch; and comparing
it with the Scripture, finding no footsteps
therein of such a sort of Witch, have thereupon
desperately concluded; that tho the Scripture is
full in it, that a Witch should not live; yet that
it has not at all described the crime, nor means
whereby the culpable might be detected.</p>

<p>And hence they are fallen so far as to reckon
it necessary to make use of those Diabolical and
Bloody ways, always heretofore practiced for their
Discovery. As finding that the Rules given to
detect other crimes, are wholly useless for the
Discovery of such.</p>

<p>This is that which has produced that deluge of
Blood mentioned, and must certainly do so again,
the same belief remaining.</p>

<p>And who can wonder, if Christians that are so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
easily prevailed with to lay aside their Swords as
useless, and so have lost their Strength (if with
<i>Samson</i>) they are led blindfold into an Idol Temple,
to make sport for Enemies and Infidels, and
to do abominable actions, not only not Christian,
but against even the light of Nature and Reason.
And now Reverend Fathers, you who are appointed
as Guides to the People, and whose Lips
should preserve Knowledge; who are set as Shepherds,
and as Watchmen, this matter appertains
to you. I did write to you formerly upon this
head, and acquainted you with my Sentiments,
requesting that, if I erred, you would be pleased
to shew it me by Scripture; but from your
silence, I gather that you approve thereof. For
I may reasonably presume, that you would have
seen it your duty to have in[51]formed me better,
if you had been sensible of any Error. But if in
this matter you have acquitted yourselves, becoming
the Titles you are dignified with, you have
cause of rejoicing in the midst of the calamities
that afflict a sinning world.</p>

<p>Particularly, if you have taught the People to
fear God, and trust in him, and not to fear a
Witch or a Devil. That the Devil has no power
to afflict any with Diseases, or loss of Cattle, &amp;c.
without a Commission from the most high. That
he is so filled with malice, that whatever Commission
he may have against any, he will not fail
to execute it. That no mortal ever was, or can
be able to Commissionate him, or to lengthen his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
Chain in the least, and that he who can Commissionate
him is God; and that the Scriptures of
truth not only assign the punishment of a Witch;
but give sufficient Rules to detect them by, and
that (according to Mr. <i>Gauls</i> fourth head,) a
Witch is one that hates and opposes the word,
work, and worship of God, and seeks by a sign to
seduce therefrom. That they who are guilty
according to that head, are guilty of Witchcraft,
and by the Law given by <i>Moses</i>, were to be put
to Death. If you have taught the People the
necessity of Charity, and the evil of entertaining
so much as a jealousie against their Neighbours
for such crimes upon the Devils suggestions to a
person pretending to a Spectral (or Diabolical)
sight; who utter their Oracles from Malice, frensie,
or a Satanical Delusion; that to be inquisitive
of such, whose Spectres they see, or who it is that
afflicts? In order to put the accused persons life
in question, is a wickedness beyond what <i>Saul</i>
was guilty of in going to the Witch. That to
consult with the dead, by the help of such as
pretend to this Spectral sight, and so to get Information
against the life of any person, is the worst
sort of Necromancy. That the pretending to
drive away Spectres, <i>i. e.</i> Devils, with the hand,
or by striking these to wound a person at a distance,
cannot be without Witchcraft, as pretending
to assign in order to deceive in matters of so
high a Nature. That 'tis Ridiculous to think by
making laws against feeding, imploying, or rewarding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
of evil Spirits, thereby to get rid of
them. That their natures require not sucking to
support it.</p>

<p>That it is a horrid Injury and Barbarity to
search those parts, which even Nature itself
commands the concealing of, to find some Excrescence
to be called a Tet for those to suck;
which yet is said sometimes to appear as a Flea-bite.
Finally if you have taught the People
what to believe and practice, as to the probation
of the Accused, by their saying, or not saying the
Lord's Prayer; and as to praying that the Afflicted
may be able to accuse; And have not
shunned in these matters to declare the whole
mind of God; you have then well acquitted
yourselves (in time of General Defection) as
faithful Watchmen. But if instead [<a id="a52a"></a>52] of this,
you have some by word and writing propagated;

<p>
<i>Reverend Sir</i>,
</p>

<p class="dropcap">AFTER that dreadful and severe Persecution
of such a Multitude of People, under the
notion of Witches, which in the day thereof, was
the sorest tryal and affliction that ever befel this
Country. And after [53] many of the principal
Actors had declared their fears and jealousies, that
they had greatly erred in those Prosecutions.
And after a Solemn day of Fasting had been
kept, with Prayers that God would shew us what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
we knew not; <i>viz.</i> what errors might therein
have been fallen into, <i>&amp;c.</i> And after most People
were convinc'd of the Evil of some, if not
of most of those Actions. At such a time as this
it might have been justly expected that the Ministers
would make it their work to Explain the
Scriptures to the People; and from thence to
have shown them, the evil and danger of those
false Notions, which not only gave some occasion;
but in a blind Zeal hurried them into those unwarrantable
practices, so to prevent a falling into
the like for the future.</p>

<p>But instead of this, for a Minister of the Gospel
(Pastor of the old Meeting<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>) to abet such
Notions; and to stir up the Magistrates to such
Prosecutions, and this without any cautions given,
is what is truly amazing, and of most dangerous
consequence.</p>

<p>It is a truth, Witchcraft is, in the Text then
insisted on, reckon'd up as a manifest work of the
Flesh. <i>Viz. Gal.</i> v. 19. But it is as true, that in
recounting those other Works (which are indeed
Manifest Fleshly Works) the Magistrate was not
stirred up against those others; but as if the rest
were either not to be taken notice of by him, or
as if all Zeal against Murder, Adulteries, <i>&amp;c.</i> was
swallowed up, and over-shadowed by this against
Witchcraft.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
The description that was then given, was that
they were such as made a Covenant with the
Devil, and sold themselves to the evil Angels. It
seems faulty, that when such Minister is inquired
of, and requested to give the Reasons, or Grounds
in Scripture of such Description; for such Minister
to assert that it is the Inquirers work to
disprove it. And his saying further, in answer
that there are many things true, that are not
asserted in Scripture; seems to speak this Language,
<i>viz.</i> that the Law of God is imperfect, in
not describing this Crime of Witchcraft, though
it be therein made Capital.</p>

<p>These perfect Oracles inform us, concerning
<i>Ahab</i>, that he sold himself to work Wickedness;
which may signifie to us, that great height of
Wickedness he had arrived at; which yet might
be, without his being properly, or justly accounted
a Witch; any more than those that are said to
have made a Covenant with Death, and with
Hell, <i>&amp;c.</i> Can it be thought that all those, or
such as are there spoken of, are Witches, and
ought to suffer as Witches?</p>

<p>As the Servants and People of God, have made
a Solemn explicit Covenant with him, <i>Josh.</i> xxiv.
25. <i>Nehem.</i> ix. 38. <i>&amp;c.</i> So no doubt a Covenant
has been made by <i>Heathen Indian</i> Nations to serve,
and adore the Devil; yet even for this, it were
very hard to affix the Character of [54] a Witch
upon each of those <i>Heathen</i> that so do: And
accordingly to Execute them as such. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
also possible, that some that have been called
Christians, have sealed a Writing, sign'd with their
own Blood, or otherways, thereby Covenanting
to be the Devil's Servants, <i>&amp;c.</i> but from far other
grounds, or inducements than what sways with
the <i>Indians</i>; these Heathen hoping to please him,
that so he may not harm them. But these having
been Educated and Confirmed in the Belief, that
by vertue of such Covenant, they shall have a
Knowledge and Power more than Humane, assisting
of them; this may have prevail'd with
some to so horrible a wickedness; for none can
seek Evil for Evils sake; but as the Serpent in
his first tempting Man, made use of the knowledge
of Good and Evil; so to teach Men that
such effects do usually follow such Covenant, is
properly the work of the Serpent; for without
this, what inducement, or temptation could they
have to make such a Covenant?</p>

<p>These having thus chosen a false God, may well
be accounted the worst sort of Idolaters. Yet it
does not hence follow that in a Scripture sense,
they are thereby become Witches, till they have,
or rather till they pretend to have assistances answerable;
and do thereby endeavour to deceive
others, which endeavours to deceive, by a sign
may be without any previous Covenant.</p>

<p>But supposing none of all those several sorts of
Covenants was intended, it remains that the Covenant,
that was understood to be intended, in that
Discourse at Old Meeting, is agreeable to the late<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
dangerous Notion that has so much prevailed,
<i>viz.</i> That the Devil appears to the persons, that
they and the Devil make mutual engagements
each to other, confirmed by signing to the Devil's
Book; and are from hence inabled, not only to
know futurities, and things done at distance; but
are also thereby empowered to do harm to the
Neighbours, to raise Storms, and do things above
and against a course of Nature: This being the
notion that has occasioned the shedding so much
Blood in the World, it may be thought to need
explaining.</p>

<p>For as Reason knows nothing of an Afflicting,
Covenanting Witch; so it seems as Forreign from
Scripture in general, as it is from the Text then
insisted on; which speaks of such wickednesses
as are manifestly the works of the flesh: but such
Communication with Spirits, the flesh doth manifestly
dread even as death itself. Therefore the
usual Salvation of the Holy Angels to the best
of Men was, fear not; and experience shews, that
the most wicked, are most afrighted at the apprehensions
of the appearances of Devils; therefore
such an explicit Covenanting cannot be a manfest
work of the Flesh.</p>

<p>[<a id="a55a"></a>55] Yet this is manifest, that the belief of the
Witches power to do the things above mentioned,
is an ancient belief of the Heathen. And that
from them it was received by the Papists, as a
part of their Faith, who have since improved
upon it, and brought in the notion of a Covenant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
But it seems yet a further improvement lately
made by Protestants, that such Witches can Commissionate
Devils to do those mischiefs, thereby
setting the Witch in the place of God; for tho
few of the Papists are known to be thus absurd;
yet when such Doctrines have been Preached, and
Printed in <i>New England</i>, they have met with
none to oppose; but many to incourage them.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
Other considerable additions or new improvements
have been made here; as the art to knock off
invisible chains with the hand, to drive away
Spectres (<i>i. e.</i> Devils) by brushing, spelling words
to the Afflicted, <i>&amp;c.</i> What has followed upon
these notions, and upon such improvements, is
needless here to repeat, it were unaccountable to
recount the effusion of Blood that has been hereby
occasioned, such remaining Scars, and such yet
bleeding wounds as are to be found; which none
can wholly pretend ignorance of.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
And if Blood shall be required of that Watchman
that seeth the Sword a coming, and gives
not the needful warning; how much more of
such as join with the Enemy, to bring in the
Sword to destroy them, over whom he was placed
a Watchman.</p>

<p>And if the law of God be perfect, and exceeding
broad, as being given forth by the Omnicient
Law-giver; it is exceeding high presumption and
arrogance, and highly destructive to the lives of
Innocents, for any to pretend to give another, and
a pretended better description of a crime made
thereby Capital, with new rules to try such offenders
by.</p>

<p><i>Reverend Sir, the matter being of such high concern
requires</i> (<i>and it is again prayed</i>) <i>that you would
be pleased to consider, and give the grounds from
Scripture, or Reason of such Definition, or else that
you would explode it, as inconsistent with both.
From, Reverend Sir, Yours to my utmost.</i></p>

He was a principal Founder

about one hundred Years, when
Dr. Belknap caused it to be printed

London procured him the Title of

Risibility under complete Controll.
If Thunder and Lightning were the
Work of the Devil, as it seems Mr.
Mather believed, it is not very
strange that he should discover some
very odd Pranks in their Operations.
The Father (Dr. I. Mather) relates,
among his <i>Philosophical Meditations</i>,
that as "a Man was walking,
in August, 1682, in the Field,
near Darking in England, he was
struck with a Clap of Thunder; on
being taken up, his dead Body was
found exceeding hot, and withall
smelling strong of Sulphur, insomuch
that they were forced to drop
him, and let him ly a considerable
Time ere he could be removed.
It is reported that sometimes Thunder
and Lightning has been generated
out of the sulphurous and
bituminous Matter which the firey
Mountain Ætna hath cast forth."</p></div>

us that the Devil commissions
the Witch, and sometimes that the
Witch governs the Devil. Hence,

The following Ideas respecting
the Devil then entertained may not
be out of Place in this Connection:
"The Devil is the oldest Sinner,
and the most cursed Creature in all
the World. It is said, Isa. 65, 20.
<i>That the Sinner of an hundred Years
shall be accursed.</i> But then what
shall the Sinner be that is more than
5000 Years old? The Devil and
all the Angels that sinned with him,
are Sinners of above 5000 Years
old, and will therefore become the
most accursed and damned Creatures
in the whole Universe at the
Great Day."&mdash;Dr. I. Mather, <i>Angelographia</i>,
120.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_60_60" id="Footnote_60_60"></a><a href="#FNanchor_60_60"><span class="label">[60]</span></a> In Answer to this, the Dr. says:
"The Reason that made me unwilling
to trust any of my Writings in
the Hands of this Man, was because
I saw the <i>Weaver</i> (though he presumes
to call himself a <i>Merchant</i>)
was a Stranger to all the Rules of
Civility." This is the Kind of Answer
which every impartial Reader
will decide, redounds entirely to the
Credit of Mr. Calef, and that <i>Civility</i>
is also altogether on his Side.
Yet, in an Air of Triumph the Doctor
adds: "The <i>Antiscriptural Doctrines</i>
espoused by this Man do also
call for no further Answer."</p></div>

interesting to have the Views of Dr.
Increase Mather respecting the Attributes
of the Devil.
</p>
<p>
"There were many of them [the
Devils Angels] that were concerned
in that first Transgression and Rebellion
against the Lord. It is said,
Ephes. 2. 3. That the Devil is <i>the
Prince of the Power of the Air</i>.
So that there is a <i>Power</i>, an <i>Host</i>,
a vast <i>Army</i> of those Evil Spirits,
that did joyn with the Devil, in setting
themselves against the Great
God. How many, is not for us to
say, the Written Word of God not
speaking anything as to the Quantity
of their Number; only it is manifest
from the Scripture, that there
are far more Angels that have sinned,
far more Devils than there are
Men in all the World. There is
not a Man in the whole World but
there are Devils to tempt him continually.
And if so, they must needs
be more in Number than Men are.
We read in the Gospel of no less
than a Legion of Devils in one poor
miserable Man. Luk. 8, 30. You
read there of a possesed Man, and
Christ demanded of the Evil Spirit
what his Name was: The chief
Devil among them made Answer,
<i>It is Legion for we are many</i>. A
Legion is six Thousand six Hundred
and Sixty-six. Now then, if the
Devil has such vast Numbers of Infernal
Spirits under him; if he has
such Troops of them, as that he can
spare no less than a Legion to afflict,
and as it were to keep Garrison in
one poor miserable Man: what
prodigious Numbers of Evil Angels
must there needs be."&mdash;<i>Angelographia</i>,
111-112. See also <i>The
Devil Discovered</i>, Vol. I, 217-247.</p></div>

on these "<i>Ten Articles</i>" should be
read in Connection: "When he
sent about unto all the Ministers
a <i>Libellous Letter</i> against myself,
falsely charging me with writing in
a Manuscript of mine <i>Ten Articles</i>
(which are of his own drawing up)
whereof the chief are of his <i>own
pure Invention</i>, there was not one
of all those reverend Persons, who
thought him worthy of an Answer.
And now his Book is come abroad,
I cannot hear (and many observe
the Like) of so much as one vertuous
and sensible Man, but let
their Opinions about the <i>Salem</i>
Troubles be what they will, they
detest it, as, a <i>Vile Book</i>; as being
an intire Libel upon the whole
<i>Government</i> and <i>Ministry</i> in the
Land; yea, they think it beneath a
Minister of the Gospel to bestow
the Pains of an <i>Answer</i> upon it.
The Book serves but as an Engine
to discover (by their approbation
of it) a few Persons in the Land
that will distinguish themselves by
an exalted <i>Malignity</i>." <i>Some Few
Remarks on a Scandalous Book</i>, 34-5.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_63_63" id="Footnote_63_63"></a><a href="#FNanchor_63_63"><span class="label">[63]</span></a> The Supposition was correct.
There was an Edition of the Work
referred to, printed in Philadelphia in
1692, in a small Quarto of 16 Pages.
Upon this Letter and the Work of
Mr. Willard Dr. Mather remarks,
evidently under great Excitement
and Indignation as respects the Former:
"I remember that when this
miserable Man sent unto an eminent
Minister in the Town, a <i>Libellous
Letter</i>, reflecting both on a Judicious
Discourse written by him, and
on the Holy Proposals made by the
Præsident and Fellows of <i>Harvard-College</i>,
about <i>recording of Remarkable
Providences</i>, and when he demanded
and expected an Answer
to his Follies, that Reverend Person
only said <i>Go tell him That the Answer
to him and his Letter is in the
Twenty Sixth of the Proverbs, and
the Fourth</i>."
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willard's Silence was undoubtedly
owing to a very different
Cause than that given by Dr. Mather.
It is fairly inferable that Mr.
Willard was too good a Logician
not to see that Mr. Calef's Argument
did not admit of Refutation,
and that his own Reputation would
be best conserved by Silence.</p></div>

Hands of the since famous James
Howell a Manuscript, attempting
to disprove the Existence of Witches.
In writing to his Friend, Sir
Edward Spencer, soon after, Howell
said: "I will not say that this Gentleman
is so perverse; but to deny
there are any Witches, to deny that
there are not ill Spirits which seduce,
tamper and converse in divers
Shapes with human Creatures, and
impel them to Actions of Malice, I
say, that he who denies there are
such busy Spirits, and such poor
passive Creatures upon whom they
work, which commonly are called
Witches; I say again, that he who
denies there are such Spirits, shews
that he himself hath a Spirit of
Contradiction in him, opposing the
current and consentient Opinion of
all Antiquity." James wrote this
Nonsense in 1647. Most certainly
if our Affairs are to be measured
by the Laws and Usages of Antiquity,
all Advancement in Knowledge
is a Crime; and instead of
being tolerated, should be prevented
by the same sanguinary Laws then
in use. Fortunately some Improvement

of the First Church in Boston from

President of Harvard College. He
was Son of Capt. Samuel Wadsworth
of Milton, who fell in the
bloody Fight at Sudbury, April the
21st, 1676. And here it may be
noted that President Wadsworth,
praiseworthily and in filial Duty,
erected a Monument to his father's
Memory, at Sudbury, on the Site
of the fierce Conflict, in which he
ended his Life; but from some Cause
easily explained, fixed the Date of
his father's Death on April 18th;
See <i>N. E. Hist. and Gen. Reg.</i> for
1853, p. 221, where the Cause of
the Error is explained. There has
been a feeble Attempt to maintain
the old Date, because it happened
ignorantly to be placed upon a new
Monument which replaced the old
One in 1852. This Attempt has
been admitted into the Register for
1866, page 135-141, as unaccountably

<p class="dropcap">THE Reasons why we withdraw from Communion

followeth.</p>

<p>Why we attend not on publick Prayer, and
preaching the word, there are,</p>

<p>[56] 1. <i>The Distracting, and Disturbing tumults,
and noises made by the persons under Diabolical
Power and delusions; preventing sometimes our
hearing, understanding, and profiting by the word
preached. We having after many Trials, and Experiences
found no redress in this matter, <span class="errauthor" title="read: accounted">accountea</span>
ourselves under a necessity to go where we might hear
the word in quiet.</i></p>

<p>2. <i>The apprehension of danger of ourselves, being
accused as the Devil's Instruments, to afflict the persons
complaining, we seeing those that we have reason
to esteem better than ourselves thus accused, blemished,
and of their lives bereaved: for seeing this, thought
it our prudence to withdraw.</i></p>

<p>3. <i>We found so frequent and positive preaching
up some Principles and Practices by Mr.</i> Parris,<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
<i>referring to the dark and dismal mystery of Iniquity

upon us; therefore thought it our most safe and
peaceable way to withdraw</i>.</p>
<p class="hang"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
<i>The Reasons why we hold not Communion with them
at the Lord's Table, are because we find ourselves

<p>1. <i>From his declared and published Principles, referring
to our molestations from the Invisible World:
Differing from the Opinion of the generality of the

<p>2. <i>His easie and strong Faith and Belief of the
before-mentioned Accusations, made by those called
the Afflicted.</i></p>

<p>3. <i>His laying aside that grace (which above all
we are to put on,) viz. Charity towards his Neighbours,
and especially those of his Church, when there
is no apparent reason, but for the contrary.</i></p>

<p>4. <i>His approving and practicing unwarrantable
and ungrounded methods, for discovering what he was
desirous to know, referring to the bewitched, or possessed
persons, as in bringing some to others, and by
them pretending to inform himself and others, who
were the Devil's instruments to afflict the sick and
maimed.</i></p>

<p>5. <i>His unsafe unaccountable Oath, given by him
against sundry of the accused.</i></p>

<p>6. <i>His not rendering to the World so fair (if so
true) account of what he wrote on Examination of
the afflicted.</i></p>

in his Preaching) which we find not warrantable
(if Christian.)</i></p>

not only to interrupt that partial peace which we
did sometimes enjoy, but also through his wiles

though totally unknown to me or mine (except
Servants) till afterwards, to raise Spirits and
Apparitions in no better than a Diabolical way,
I do also look upon as a further rebuke of Divine
Providence. And by all, I do humbly own this

has been righteously spitting in my face, <i>Numb.</i>

after-considerations, that were the same troubles
again, (which the Lord of his rich mercy forever
prevent) I should not agree with my former
apprehensions in all points. As for Instance,</p>

<p>1. I question not but God sometimes suffers
the Devil, as of late, to afflict in shape of not
only Innocent, but Pious persons, or so to delude
the Senses of the afflicted, that they strongly conceit
their hurt is from such persons, when indeed
it is not.</p>

<p>2. The improving of one afflicted to inquire
by who afflicts the other, I fear may be, and has
been unlawfully used to Satan's great Advantage.</p>

<p>3. As to my writing, it was put upon me by
Authority, and therein I have been very careful
to avoid the wronging of any.</p>

<p>4. As to my Oath I never meant it, nor do I
know how it can be otherwise construed, than as
vulgarly, and every one understood, yea, and
upon inquiry it may be found so worded also.</p>

<p>5. As to any passage in preaching, or praying
in the sore hour of distress and darkness, I always
intended but due Justice on each hand, and that
not according to Men but God; who knows all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
things most perfectly; however through weakness,
or sore exercise, I might sometimes, yea and
possibly sundry times unadvisedly express myself.</p>

<p>6. As to several that have confessed against
themselves, they being wholly strangers to me,
but yet of good account with better Men than
myself, to whom also they are well known, I do
not pass so much as a secret condemnation upon
them. But rather seeing God hath so amazingly
lengthened out Satan's Chain, in this most formidable
outrage, I much more incline to side
with the Opinion of those that have grounds to
hope better of them.</p>

<p>7. As to all that have unduly suffered in these
matters, either in their Persons or Relations,
through the clouds of human weakness, and Satan's
wiles and sophistry, I do truly sympathize
with them, taking it for granted, that such as
know themselves clear of this great transgression,
or that have sufficient grounds so to look upon
their dear Friends, have hereby been under those
sore tryals and temptations, that not an ordinary
measure of true grace would be sufficient to prevent
a bewraying of remaining corruption.</p>

<p>8. I am very much in the mind, and abundantly
perswaded that God for holy ends (though
for what in particular, is best known to himself)
has suffered the Evil Angels to delude us on both
hands; but how far on the one side, or the other,
is much above me to say, and if we cannot reconcile
till we come to a full discerning of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
things, I fear we shall never come to an agreement,
or at soonest not in this World.</p>

<p>[<a id="a59a"></a>59] Therefore in fine, the matter being so
dark and perplexed, as that there is no present
appearance, that all God's Servants should be altogether
of one mind in all circumstances, touching
the same; I do most heartily, fervently, and humbly
beseech pardon of the merciful God, through
the Blood of Christ for all my mistakes and trespasses
in so weighty a matter. And also all your
forgiveness of every offence, in this or other
affairs, wherein you see or conceived that I have
erred and offended, professing in the presence of
the Almighty God, that what I have done has
been as for substance as I apprehended was [my]
duty, however thro' weakness, Ignorance, <i>&amp;c.</i> I
may have been mistaken. I also thro' grace
promising each of you the like of me; so again
I beg, intreat, and beseech you, that Satan, the
Devil, the roaring Lion, the old Dragon, the
Enemy of all Righteousness, may no longer be
served by us, by our Envy and Strifes, where every
evil work prevails whilst these bear sway, <i>James</i>
iii. 14, 15, 16. But that all from this day forward
may be covered with the mantle of love,
and we may on all hands forgive each other
heartily, sincerely and thoroughly, as we do hope
and pray, that God for Christ's sake would forgive
each of ourselves, <i>Mat.</i> xviii. 21. to the end.
<i>Colos.</i> iii. 12, 13. <i>Put on therefore</i> (<i>as the elect of
God, holy and beloved</i>) <i>bowels of mercies, kindness,</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
<i>humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering; Forbearing
one another, and forgiving one another, if
any man have a quarrel against any, even as Christ
forgave you, so also do ye.</i> Eph. iv. 31, 32. <i>Let
all bitterness, and anger, and clamour, and evil-speaking
be put away from you with all malice.
And be ye kind one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving
one another, even as God for Christ's sake,
hath forgiven you.</i> Amen. Amen.</p>

<h3><i>The Elders and Messengers of the churches
met at</i> Salem <i>Village</i>, April 3, 1695, <i>to
consider and determine what is to be done,
for the composure of the present unhappy
differences in that place. After solemn
invocation of God in Christ for his direction,
do unanimously declare, as followeth</i>,
viz.</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap"><span class="dropfix">1.</span>&nbsp;W</span>E judge that all be it in the late and dark
time of the confusions, wherein Satan
had obtained a more than ordinary liberty, to
be sifting of this Plantation, there were sundry unwarrantable,
and uncomfortable steps, taken by
Mr. <i>Samuel Parris</i>, the Pastor of the Church in
<i>Salem</i> Village, then under the hurrying distractions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
of amazing Afflictions; yet the said Mr. <i>Parris</i>,
by the good hand of God brought unto a better
sense of things, hath so fully exprest it, that a
Christian charity may and should receive satisfaction
therewith.</p>

<p>[60] 2. Inasmuch as diverse Christian Brethren,
in the Church of <i>Salem</i> Village, have been
offended at Mr. <i>Parris</i>, for his conduct in the
time of their difficulties, which have distressed
them; we now advise them Charitably to accept
the satisfaction which he hath tendered in his
Christian acknowledgment of the Errors therein
committed; yea to endeavour, as far as it is possible,
the fullest reconciliation of their minds unto
Communion with him, in the whole Exercise of
his Ministry, and with the rest of the Church,
<i>Matt.</i> vi. 12, 14. <i>Luke</i> xvii. 3. <i>James</i> v. 16.</p>

<p>3. Considering the extream tryals and troubles,
which the dissatisfied Brethren in the Church of
<i>Salem</i> Village have undergone, in the day of sore
temptation, which hath been upon them; we
cannot but advise the Church to treat them with
bowels of much compassion, instead of all more
critical, or rigorous proceedings against them for
the Infirmities discovered by them, in such an
heart-breaking day; and if after a patient waiting
for it, the said Brethren cannot so far overcome
the uneasiness of their Spirits, in the remembrance
of the disasters that have hapned, as to sit under
his Ministry; we advise the Church with all
tenderness to grant them admission to any other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
Society of the Faithful, whereunto they may be
desired to be dismist. <i>Gal.</i> vi. 1, 2. <i>Psal.</i> ciii. 13,
14. <i>Job</i> xix. 21.</p>

<p>4. Mr. <i>Parris</i> having (as we understand) with
much fidelity and integrity acquitted himself, in
the main course of his Ministry, since he hath
been Pastor of the Church of <i>Salem</i> Village;
about his first call whereunto, we look upon all
contestations now to be both unreasonable and
unseasonable: And our Lord having made him a
blessing to the Souls of not a few, both old and
young in this place, we advise that he be accordingly
respected, honour'd and supported, with all
the regards that are due to a painful Minister of
the gospel. 1 <i>Thes.</i> v. 12, 13. 1 <i>Tim.</i> v. 17.</p>

<p>5. Having observed that there is in <i>Salem</i> Village,
a Spirit full of contention and animosity, too
sadly verifying the blemish which hath heretofore
lain upon them: And that some complaints
against Mr. <i>Parris</i> have been either causeless, or
groundless, or unduly aggravated; we do in the
name and fear of the Lord solemnly warn them
to consider, whether if they continue to devour
one another it will not be bitterness in the latter
end, and beware lest the Lord be provoked thereby
utterly to deprive them of those (which they
should count) their precious and pleasant things,
and abandon them to all the desolations of a People
that sin away the Mercies of the Gospel.
<i>James</i> iii. 16. <i>Gal.</i> v. 15. 2 <i>Sam.</i> ii. 26. <i>Isa.</i>
v. 45. <i>Mat.</i> xxi. 43.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>

6. If the Distempers in <i>Salem</i> Village should
be (which God forbid) so incurable, that Mr.
<i>Parris</i> after all find that he cannot with any
comfort and service continue in his present Station,
his removal from thence will [<a id="a61a"></a>61] not expose
him to any hard Character with us; nor we hope
with the rest of the People of God, among whom
we live. <i>Matt.</i> x. 14. <i>Acts</i> xxii. 18. All which
advice we follow, with our Prayers that the God
of Peace would bruise Satan under our Feet; now
the Lord of Peace himself give you Peace always
by all means.</p>

<p class="dropcap">WE <i>whose Names are hereunto Subscribed, are

liberty of debating the whole of our Controversie;
whereby yourselves had not so large an opportunity
of understanding the Case; nor the offended so much

humbly propose, and give full liberty of proving and
defending of what may be charged on either hand,

<p>1. <i>That if yourselves please to take the trouble

<p>2. <i>Or that you will more plainly advise Mr.</i> Parris,
(<i>the Case being so circumstanced, that he cannot
with comfort or profit, to himself or others, abide in
the Work of the Ministry among us</i>) <i>to cease his
labours, and seek to dispose himself elsewhere, as God
in his Providence may direct: and that yourselves
would please to help us in advising to such a choice,
wherein we may be more unanimous; which we hope
would tend much to a composure of our differences.</i></p>

<p>3. <i>Or, that we may without any offence take the
liberty of calling some other proved Minister of the
Gospel, to Preach the Word of God to us and ours:</i>
[<a id="a62a"></a>62] <i>and that we may not be denied our proportionable
privilege, in our publick disbursments in the

<p>So leaving the whole case with the Lord and
yourselves, we Subscribe our Names. Signed by
16 young Men, from 16 upwards; and 52 Housholders,

<h3>Some part of the Determination of the
Elders and Messengers of the Churches,
met at <i>Salem</i> Village, <i>April</i> 3, 1695,
relating to the Differences there. </h3>

<p class="dropcap">IF <i>the Distemper in</i> Salem <i>Village should be</i> (which
God forbid) <i>so incurable that Mr.</i> Parris <i>after
all, find that he cannot with any comfort and service
continue in this present station, his removal from

God, among whom we live</i>, Mat. x. 14. And whosoever
shall not receive you, nor hear your words;
when you depart out of that house, or city, shake
off the dust of your feet, <i>&amp;c.</i> Acts xxii. 18.

<p><i>Quest.</i> Whether Mr. <i>Parris</i> his going to <i>Abi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>gail
Williams</i><a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> (and others) whom he supposed to
have a Spectral sight (to be informed who were
Witches and who afflicted those pretended sufferers
by Witchcraft) in order to their being questioned
upon their lives for it, were not a turning
after such as had familiar Spirits; and a greater
wickedness than <i>Saul</i> was guilty of (in that he
did not intend thereby bodily hurt to any others.)</p>

<p>And whether in a crime of such a high nature,
the making a slender and general confession, without
any proposals of reparations, or due time of
probation, ought so far to be accounted sufficient,
from such a Pastor to his People.</p>

<p>[<a id="a63a"></a>63] And whether such as were accused, or
the surviving Friends and Relations of those that
were any ways sufferers, by Accusations so by him
proved, are in duty and conscience bound to continue
their respect, honour and support to him, in
the Ministry, after such known departures from
the Rule of Gods word, and after such dire effects
as followed thereupon, under the penalty <i>of
the dust shaken from his feet</i>, testifying against
them, even so as to render them in a worse case
than those of <i>Sodom</i> and <i>Gomorrah</i>.</p>

<p class="dropcap">THE Remonstrances of several aggrieved persons
in the said Village, with further reasons
why they conceive they ought not to hear Mr.
<i>Parris</i>, nor to own him as a Minister of the
Gospel, nor to contribute any support to him as
such, for several Years past; humbly offered as fit
for consideration.</p>

<p>We humbly conceive that having in <i>April</i> 1693,
given our Reasons why we could not join with
Mr. <i>Parris</i> in Prayer, Preaching, or Sacraments.
If these Reasons are found sufficient for our withdrawing,
(and we cannot yet find but they are)
Then we conceive ourselves virtually discharged,
not only in Conscience, but also in Law; which
requires maintenance to be given to such as are
Orthodox, and blameless. The said Mr. <i>Parris</i>
having been teaching such dangerous Errors, and
preached such scandalous Immoralities, as ought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>to discharge any (tho ever so gifted otherways)
from the work of the Ministry.</p>

<p>Particularly in his Oath against the lives of
several, wherein he swears that the Prisoners with
their looks knock down those pretended sufferers.
We humbly conceive, that he that Swears to
more than he is certain of, is equally guilty of
Perjury, with him that Swears to what is false.
And tho they did fall at such a time, yet it could
not be known that they did it, much less could
they be certain of it; yet did Swear positively
against the lives of such, as he could not have any
knowledge but they might be Innocent.</p>

<p>His believing the Devil's Accusations, and readily
departing from all Charity to persons, tho of
blameless and godly lives, upon such suggestions,
his promoting such Accusations, as also his partiality
therein, in stifling the Accusations of some,
and the same time vigilantly promoting others;
as we conceive are just causes for our refusal, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>That Mr. <i>Parris's</i> going to <i>Mary Walcut</i>,<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> or
<i>Abigail Williams</i>, and directing others to them, to
know who afflicted the People in their illnesses;
[<a id="a64a"></a>64] we understand this to be a dealing with
them that have a familiar spirit, and an implicit
denying the providence of God, which alone, as
we believe, can send Afflictions, or cause Devils
to Afflict any; this we also conceive sufficient to
justifie such refusal.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span></p>
<p>That Mr. <i>Parris</i> by these Practices and Principles,
has been the beginner and procurer of the
sorest Afflictions, not to this Village only, but to
this whole Country, that did ever befal them.</p>

<p>We the Subscribers, in behalf of ourselves, and
of several others of the same mind with us
(touching these things) having some of us had
our Relations by these practices taken off by an
untimely Death; others have been imprisoned,
and suffered in our Persons, Reputations, and Estates;
submit the whole to your Honours decision,
to determine whether we are or ought to be any
ways obliged to honour, respect and support such
an Instrument of our miseries; praying God to
guide your Honours, to act herein, as may be for
his Glory, and the future settlement of our Village,
in Amity and Unity.</p>

Joseph Bridgham was probably
the Son of Henry, of Dorchester,
and afterwards of Boston, born in
1651. He was a Member of the
Artillery Company, Representative,
and in other Walks a prominent

<i>Checkley</i> was the Minister of
the New South Church, Boston.
Jeremiah Dummer was the well
known Author, the <i>Defence of the
New England Charters</i>. Nehemiah
<i>Jewett</i>, I suppose, was of Ipswich,
a Representative, and, at
one Time, Speaker of the House,
and died about 1720. James Allen
was Minister of the First Church,
Boston. Samuel <i>Torrey</i> was Minister
of Weymouth, and died in
1707. William <i>Torrey</i> was also
of Weymouth, and Brother of the
Rev. Samuel. Joseph Boynton was
of Rowley. Richard <i>Middlecott</i>
was of Boston. John Walley was
probably the Major Walley who
shared the Disgrace of the ill advised
and iller executed Expedition
against Canada, under Sir William
Phips. Hunt was another of
Phips's Colonels, &amp;c., was of Weymouth,
and died 1713. Williams
was probably the <i>Nathaniel</i>
Williams, of Boston, a Commissary
in Philip's War. <i>Samuel</i> Phillips
was the Minister of Rowley, perhaps,
who died in 1696. <i>Samuel</i>
Willard, of the Old South, Author
of <i>A Body of Divinity</i>, and
other theological Work, Vice-President
of Harvard College, &amp;c.; he
died in 1707. See Note <i>ante.

validity of such a sort of Evidence,
as was not so clearly and directly
demonstrable to Human Senses, as
in other Cases is required or else
they could not discover the Mysteries
of Witchcraft; I presume not
to impose upon my <i>Christian</i> or
<i>Learned</i> Reader; any opinion of
mine, how far <i>Satan</i> was an Instrument
in God's Hand, in those
amazing Afflictions, which were on
many Persons there, [at Salem]
about that time; but I am certainly
convinced, that the Great <span class="smcap">God</span> was
pleased to lengthen his Chain to a
very great Degree, for the hurting
of <i>Some</i> and reproaching of <i>Others</i>,
as far as he was permitted to do
so."&mdash;Lawson, <i>pages</i> 93-4.

<p>
From this Author's uncertain
view of the Operations of the
Devil (which was the View of a
great majority of the World), it is
not at all strange that some among
the very Conscientious people inquired
as to the Difference between
the Malignant and Supreme Power;
that is, if the Supreme controlled
the Malignant, there was no question
to whom the Consequences
were to be charged; and hence
it is in no wise to be wondered
at that some in their Simplicity
could not understand what use there
was for any Devil at all, mutch less
for Witches.</p></div>

<h2>PART IV.</h2>

<h3><i>A Letter of a Gentleman</i><a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
<i>endeavouring to
prove the received Opinions about Witchcraft.</i></h3>

<p>
<i>SIR</i>,
</p>

<p class="dropcap">I Told you, I had some thoughts concerning
Witchcraft, and an Intention of conferring with
the Gentleman,<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> who has published several Treatises
about Witchcraft, and persons afflicted by
them, lately here in <i>New-England</i>; but since you
have put those three Books into my hands, I find
myself engaged in a very hard Province, to give
you my opinion of them. I plainly foresee, that
should this scribling of mine come to [65] publick
view, it would displease all Parties, but that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>is the least; moreover it is so far out of my Road
to set my thoughts to consider a matter on every
side, which in itself is so abstruce, and every step
I advance therein, if I miss truth (which is a
narrow and undivided line) I must tumble down
headlong into the Gulph of dangerous error; yet
notwithstanding I have forced myself to send
these few lines, if so be I may clear to you a
truth, you now seem to be offended at, because
of the ill consequences, which (you think) lately
have and again may be drawn from it, by the ill
conduct of some Men. I am not ignorant that
the pious frauds of the Ancient, and the inbred
fire (I do not call it pride) of many of our
Modern Divines have precipitated them to propagate,
and maintain truth as well as falsehood, in
such an unfair manner, as has given advantage to
the Enemy, to suspect the whole Doctrine, these
Men have profest to be nothing but a meer trick.
But it is certain, that as no lover of truth will
justifie an Illegitimate Corollary, tho drawn from
a true Proposition; so neither will he reject a
truth, because some or many Men take unfair
mediums to prove it, or draw false consequences
from it: The many Heresies among Christians,
must not give a mortal wound to the Essence of
the Christian Religion; neither must any one
Christian Doctrine be exterminated, because Evil
Men make use of it, as a Cloak to cover their
own self-ends; particularly, because some men
perhaps among all sorts of Christians, have under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
pretence of Witchcraft coloured their own Malice,
Pride and Popularity; we must not therefore
conclude (first) that there are no Witches (2.) or
that Witches cannot be Convicted by such clear
and undeniable proof, as the Law of God requires
in the case of Death (3.) Or that a Witch so
Convicted ought not to be put to death. 1. That
there are Witches is manfest from the precept of
<i>Moses</i>, <i>Thou shalt not suffer a Witch to live</i>. Exod.
xxii. 18. for it is certain God would not have
given a vain and unintelligible Law, as this must
be of putting Witches to death, if there are no
Witches. But you object that this doth not
answer our Case, for we have formed another
Idea of Witches than what can be gathered from
Scriptures; you quote four places, <i>viz. Deut.</i> xiii.
<i>Mat.</i> xxiv. <i>Acts</i> xiii. 2. <i>Tim.</i> iii. from all which
you infer that Witchcraft is a maligning and
oppugning the Word, Works and Worship of
God; and by an extraordinary sign, seeking to
seduce any from it, and this you readily grant.
But then you say, What is this to Witches now a
days? who are said to have made an explicit
Covenant with the Devil, and to be impowered
by him, to the doing of things strange in themselves,
and besides their natural course. This you
say does not follow, and herein indeed consists the
whole Controversie. Therefore it is necessary,
that first of all we clear this point, laying aside
those prejudices we may have from the fatal application
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>of this Doctrine, [66] to some (who
were in your judgment) really at least in Law,
and before Men Innocent. In a word, we are
seeking after truth, and truth shall and will be
truth, in spite of Men and Devils. I do not
repeat this caution to forestall you, to believe the
Doctrine of Witchcraft, as it is above defined,
without inquiring into the reason and truth of it;
only I desire you to enquire into it, as a thing
doubtful. For no Man can be certain of a Negative,
unless either the Affirmative imply a contradiction,
or he can prove it by certain testimony,
to neither of which you pretend; only you alledge
it cannot be proved by Scripture, <i>i. e.</i> you
cannot prove it, nor have seen it proved by any
other you have read on that Subject. I am not
so vain as to think I can do better than the learned
Authors you have consulted with (though I know
not what they have done, for I had no other
Book but the Bible, to make use of on this occasion;)
but because I am satisfied myself, I am
willing to communicate my Reasons, which I
divide into Three heads. 1. The appearance of
Angels. 2. The nature of Possession. 3 and the
scripture notion of Witchcraft. 1. Good Angels
did appear to <i>Abraham</i>, and did eat, <i>Gen.</i> xv. it
seems he wash'd their Feet, it is certain he saw
and heard them, therefore there is no impossibility
in Angels being conversant with men. God is
true, and whatever is contained in Sacred Writ is
true; if we poor shallow Mortals do not comprehend
the manner how, that argues only our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
weakness and ignorance in this dark Prison of
Flesh, wherein we are inclosed, during our abode
in this vale of misery, but doth not in the least
infringe the verity of the Scripture; it is sufficient
that we undoubtedly know they have appeared
unto Men in bodily shape, and done their Errand
they were sent on from God. Now if good Angels
have appeared, why may not bad? Surely
the Devils, because fallen and Evil, have not
therefore lost the Nature of Angels, neither is
there any contradiction in their appearing in a
bodily shape, now after any more than before
their Fall. But you will say you must allow of
the appearances of Good Angels, because of the
Scripture testimony; but not of bad, seeing there
is no place of Scripture that clearly proves it.
<i>Mat.</i> 4. The words in the Gospel do as plainly
signifie the Devils outward appearance to our
Saviour, when he was tempted, as can be express'd,
<i>and when the tempter came to him he said</i>&mdash;<i>but
he answered</i>&mdash;the same form St. <i>Luke</i> useth
to signifie the appearance of <i>Moses</i> and <i>Elias</i>, in
the transfiguration, <i>And behold there talked with
him two men</i>: for what follows, ver. 31, <i>who appeared</i>
is used to signifie (not their appearance,
but) the manner of their appearance <i>in great
Glory</i>. But you'l urge that 'tis very easie to be
understood, that <i>Moses</i> and <i>Elias</i> did appear, because
they had human bodies; but that it is unintelligible
to you, how the Devil being a Spirit
can appear, a Spirit, <i>i. e.</i> a substance void of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
dimensions; therefore the words in [67] the
History must not be taken in a literal Sense.
Do not mistake; tho some Philosophers are of
opinion (which whether true or false, is all one
to our present Argument) that a Spirits substance
is extended, and hath besides length, breadth and
depth, a fourth dimension, <i>viz.</i> essential spissitude;
yet the same do not say, that pure substance is
perceptible by our bodily senses; on the contrary,
they tell us, that Spirits are cloathed with vehicles,
<i>i. e.</i> they are united to certain portions of
matter, which they inform, move and actuate.
Now this we must not reject as impossible, because
we cannot comprehend the formal reason,
how a Spirit acts upon matter: For who can give
the Reason, that upon the Volition of the human
Soul, the Hand should be lifted up, or any ways
moved? for to say the Contraction of the Muscles
is the Mechanick cause of voluntary motion,
is not to solve the Question which recurs, why
upon Volition should that Contraction ensue
which causes that motion? all that I know the
wisest Man ever said upon this head, is, that it is
the will of the Creator; who hath ordered such a
species of thinking Creatures, by a Catholick Law
to be united to such portions of matter, so and
so disposed, or, if you will in the vulgar Phrase,
to Organiz'd bodies, and that there should be
between them and the several bodies, they are
united to, a mutual re-action and passion: Now
you see how little we know of the reason, of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
which is most near to us, and most certain, <i>viz.</i>
The Souls informing the Body, yet you would
think it a bad Argument, if one should, as some
have done, include from this our Ignorance, that
there was nothing in us but matter, it is no otherways
to deny a Spirits acting a Vehicle. The
plainest and most certain things when denied are
hardest to be proved, therefore the Axiom saith
well, <i>contra principa, &amp;c.</i> There are some certain
truths which are rather to be explained to
young beginners than proved, upon which yet all
Science is built, as every whole is more than his
part, and of this sort I take these two following.
1. That there are two substances, <i>Corpus &amp; Mens</i>,
Body and Spirit, altogether different, for the Ideas
we have of them are quite distinct. 2. That a
Spirit can Actuate, Animate, or inform a certain
portion of matter, and be united to it: from
whence it is very evident, that the Devil united
to a portion of matter (which hereafter I'll call a
Vehicle) may fall under the cognizance of our
Senses, and be conversant with us in a bodily
shape. Where then is the reason or need to run
to a Metaphorical, and forced Interpretation,
when the words are so plain, and the literal sense
implieth no contradiction, nor any greater difficulty
than (as has been said) what ariseth from
the Union of the Soul and Body, which is most
certain. Now after all to say, God <i>will not</i> permit
the Devil so to appear, is to beg the question
without saying any thing to the preceeding Ar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>gument,
and it is against the sense of almost all
mankind; [68] for in all Ages, and all places
there have been many Witnesses of the appearances
of <i>Dæmons</i>, all of whom that taught any
thing contrary to the right Worship of the true
God, were certainly evil ones: and it were most
presumptuous, barely to assert that all these witnesses
were always deceived, and it is impossible
they could all agree to deceive. 2. We come to
consider the nature of Possession. The Man
possest, <i>Luk.</i> viii. 27. had a Power more than
Natural, for he break the bands, which he could
not have done by his own strength: Now from
whom had he this Power? The Scripture saith,
he had Devils along time, and oftentimes it had
caught him, <i>&amp;c.</i> he was kept bound with Chains
and in Fetters, and he break the bands, and was
driven of the Devil into the Wilderness; this
Power then was immediately from the Devil,
and whatsoever possessed persons does, or suffers
things beyond his natural power; he is inabled
by the <i>Dæmon</i> so to do: or to speak more properly,
it is the <i>Dæemon</i> who acteth the same, as is
plain from St. <i>Mark's</i> Relation of this passage, v.
5. 2. A Man with an unclean Spirit, v. 3. 2.
and no Man could bind him, no, not with Chains,
6. v. but when he saw Jesus afar off he ran and
worshiped him, and the same He. v. 7. said I
adjure thee by God that thou torment me not,
and <i>v.</i> 10. My name is <i>Legion</i>, for we are many,
<i>v.</i> 11. and he besought him much, that he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
not send <i>them</i> away out of the Countrey: it is
manifest from hence, that it was not the poor
Man who was possest, but the Devils who possessed
him, by whom the Chains had been pluck'd
asunder, and the Fetters broken in pieces; now
here is Divine testimony, that the Devils have
actuated a Humane body to the doing of things
beyond the Natural strength of that Body, as it
was simply united to its humane Soul; how much
more then can the Devil actuate any other proportion
of simple Matter, Earth, Air, Fire or
Water; and make it a fit organ for himself to
act in.</p>

<p><i>But enough of this already, let us rather enquire
how the Devil enters into the body of the possestt, to
move it at his pleasure; this I think he cannot do
as a meer Spirit, or by any never so strict Union
with the Humane Soul, for in that case he is only a
tempter or seducer; and nothing above humane
strength can be done: But here there being something
performed (the bonds broken) by a force which
could not proceed from humane strength, it necessarily
follows that the Devils entered into the possest, otherways
qualified than as a meer Spirit, he did not enter
without some portion of matter, to which he was
united by the Intermedium whereof he acted upon
and actuated the humane body. Again if it is said
that the Devil entered as a meer Spirit, and immediately
aced upon and moved that body; it follows
the Devil hath a Vehicle, a certain portion of matter
(that Body) to actuate and dispose of at will;</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
<i>which is absurd.</i> 1. <i>Because it asserts what it
seems to deny, viz. the Devils having a Vehicle to
act immediately upon, and to be united to a portion
of matter</i> (<i>as</i> [69] <i>has been said before</i>) <i>is the same
thing.</i> 2. <i>It fights against the Catholick Law of
the Union of Soul and Body, by which the Omnipotent
hath ordained the voluntary motion of a humane
body to depend upon the Will of its humane Soul, and
those that are not voluntary to proceed either from
its own Mechanison, or from material force, hence
we may certainly conclude, that it is by the Intervening
of the Devils Vehicle, that he enters into the
Body of the possest. But what if you and I cannot
agree about this Notion of Possession, must we therefore
reject the truth itself, and run to a far fetched
and intolerable sense of the words: No, our opinions
do not alter the Nature of things, it is certain there
were persons possest, and it is as certain that the
Devil enteed into them, either with or without a
Vehicle, it is all one which part of the contradiction
you take, the consequence is the same, viz.</i></p>

<p><i>That the Devil doth act immediately upon matter,
there is another acceptation of the word possession in
Scripture, Acts</i> xvi. 16, <i>where one is said to be
possest with a Spirit of Divination,</i> (πνεῦμα Πύθωνος)
<i>the word commonly used to the Priestess of</i> Apollo,
<i>who gave responses; and it seems this Damsel was
such an one, for she brought her Masters much Money,
or gain by soothsaying. Now if the History of
them be true that they were demented, and knew
not themselves what they uttered,</i> donec erant Deo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
plenæ, (<i>as they word it</i>) <i>their case is not different,
but the same with the foregoing; but if they understood
what they spoke, then had they familiar Spirits,
whereof there is frequent mention made in the Old
Testament, and one good King is commended for having
cut off them that had such, therefore I think
the meaning of the word was very obvious in his
time, neither was it ever controverted, being joyned
with any other name than spirit Familiar, one of our
own Family, that is oft, every day conversant with
us, and almost ever ready upon call to attend us.
But the consideration of them, who have familiar
Spirits falleth under the head of Witchcraft,
which we are to consider in the third place.</i> 3.
<i>Witchcraft, to inquire into the Scripture Notion of
it, and compare whether it be the same with that
above defined; the Cabalistick learning would be of
great use in this search, and afford us much light;
there is little doubt but that there are many great
truths not commonly known.</i> (Non est Religio ubi
omnia patent.) <i>And our Saviour expressly cautions
his Disciples that they do not throw their Pearl before
Swine; therefore it is no wonder that some
Doctrines, tho' unquestionably true are not so fully
described, because the Authors who treat of them
are afraid, lest evil Men should be the more depraved
by being informed; but I am in no such fear; nor
can I give you any other thoughts but what are obvious
to any Man, from the plain sense of the Scripture.
Our definition we'l divide into two Propositions,
and handle them severally.</i> 1. <i>Proposition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
The Witch is impower'd by the Devil to do things
strange in themselves, and beside their natural course.
2. Prop. The manner how the Witch is impowered
to do those strange things, is by Explicit Com</i>[70]<i>pact,
or Covenant with the Devil. For clearing of
the first, we will consider the four places above cited,
wherein a Witch is called a false Prophet, a false
Christ, a Sorcerer, a resister of the truth, and is
said to shew signs to seduce the People to seek after
other Gods: whence let us note, 3 things.</i> 1. <i>That
those terms Witch, false Christ, false Prophet, and
Sorcerer, are all Synonimous; i. e. signifie the same
thing.</i> 2. <i>That a Witch doth do things strange in
themselves, and beyond their Natural course: for it
were most ridiculous, to alledge that our blessed
Saviour, when he said,</i> there shall arise false Christs,
and shall shew great signs and wonders, in so
much that (if it were possible) they should deceive
the very Elect <i>meant that cunning cheats
should arise and shew Legerdemain tricks; the words
will in no wise bear it, and I believe you are from
interpreting them, so it is manifest, they signifie not
a feign'd, but a real doing of things, beyond their
Natural course; therefore the Sorceries of</i> Elimas<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>
<i>and</i> Simon <i>were not simple delusions, but real effects
that could not have been produced by Physical causes
in the ordinary course of nature.</i> 3. <i>That the end
of the Witches shewing these signs, is to seduce the
People to seek after other Gods, from which premises
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>I infer, that the Witches have the power of doing
those wonders, or strange things immediately from
the Devil: they are without the reach of Nature,
and therefore above humane power, and no meer Man
can effect them; the Witch then who does them must
have the power of doing them from another; but
who is the other? God will not give his testimony
to a lye, and to say God did at any time impower a
Witch to work wonders to gain belief to the Doctrine
of Devils were with one breath to destroy root
and branch of all revealed Religion; no, it cannot
be, it is only God's permission, who proveth his People,
whether they love him with all their heart, and
with all their Soul. Therefore the Witch has a
power of doing Wonders, or strange things immediately
from the Devil.</i> 2. <i>Proposit. we'll subdivide
into these two. 1. That there is an express Covenant
between the Witch and the Devil.</i> 2. <i>That
'tis not reasonable to suppose this Covenant to be
transacted mentally.</i> 1. <i>The Devil cannot communicate
this power, by never so strict a Union with
the Soul of the Witch; for in that case he is only a
tempter, and nothing above humane power can be
done, as has been already proved; therefore the Devil
who improves the Witch to do things above humane
power, must either appear in an External shape, and
instruct him how, and upon what terms he will inable
him to do those Wonders; or else he must enter into
the body of the Witch and possess it. The Demoniacs
in the Gospel are such whom the Devils invade, by
main force, their Soul having no further command
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
of their bodies, which are subjected to the Will of the
Devils; whose end is to wound and torment those
miserable Creatures, to throw them into the fire, and
into the water; but the Witch, who likewise is possessed,
is not treated in such an outrageous manner;
his</i> Dæmon <i>is tame and familiar unto him, and suffers
him for</i> [71] <i>a time to live quietly, without any
further molestation, then prompting him to do his
utmost endeavour to withdraw Men from God; he is
not bereaved of his Senses as the poor lunatick, but is
conscious of all he does, and willeth all his crimes, he
receiveth power from the Devil to do wonders, and
doth them to serve the Devils turn. Therefore there
must be a Covenant, an express Covenant between the
Devil and him, viz. that he shall obey the Devil and
serve him, and that the Devil shall both enable him
so to do, and also reward him for so doing; for if
there is no contract between them, How comes the
Witch to know he has a supernatural power? or how
can he so peremptorily pretend to do that which is so
much above his natural power, not knowing he has a
supernatural one inabling him to do the same: There
can be no doubt but there was a very intimate commerce
between Satan and him; who is call'd by</i> St.
Paul <i>thou child of the Devil</i> (<i>not as other unholy
men</i>) <i>but in an especial manner, as being the Enemy
of all righteousness, who would not cease to pervert
the right ways of the Lord, it is not to be supposed
that he enter'd into this so near a Relation with Satan,
with which he is stigmatized, that others may
beware of him, without his own knowledge and con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>sent;
and is not this a Covenant, an express Covenant
on his part to serve the Devil incessantly, and
on the Devils to impower him to act his Sorceries
wherewith he bewitched the People; now I think, I
have from Scripture fully satisfied you of the truth
of what I offered, in a Discourse at&mdash;&mdash; but since
you have told me an Explicit Covenant with the
Devil, signifying the Devil's appearing in a bodily
shape to the Witch, and their signing an express
Covenant, which you say cannot be proved from
Scripture. It were most unreasonable to imagine
that the ceremonies of this hellish mystery are particularly
set down in the word of God; therefore we
must gather by Analogy and Reason the manner how
this express Covenant is transacted: and to that
end I'le set down these following Considerations.</i></p>

<p>1. Under the Law God did ordain his People
in all their matters to have recourse immediately
to himself, and depend upon him for Counsil,
which they were ready to obey, with full assurance
of aid and protection from him against their
Enemies; this the Devil imitateth by setting up
of Oracles among the Heathen, to which all
the Kings, Nations, and mighty Conquerors,
upon Earth did come, and paid their humblest
adoration to the God (as the Devil blasphemously
call'd himself) of the Temple, in which they
were imploring his direction and assistance in
their doubtful and prosperous affairs. Again,
God instituted Sacrifices to put Men in mind of
their duty to their Creator, to whom they owe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
all things, even themselves; but the Devil is not
contented with the bare imitation hereof; the
acknowledgment and worship he receiveth from
the deluded World is not enough, tho' they offer
up unto him innumerable Hecatombs, unless they
cause their Children to pass through the [72] fire
unto him, to whom no sacrifice is so well pleasing
as that of humane blood. And there is no reason
to think, that now under the Œconomy of the
Gospel, the Devil hath left off to vie with God,
and thereby to ensnare Men. No, it is rather to
be feared that his Kingdom doth now more prevail,
for by how much the light is greater; so
much greater is their condemnation, who do not
receive it: it is reasonable to suppose that (seeing
the Son of God, when he came to transact with
Men, the wonderful Covenant of their Redemption,
took upon him their Nature, and was perfect
Man) the Devil likewise doth counterfeit
the same, in appearing in an humane shape to
them, who receive him, and confederate themselves
with him, and become his Vassals.</p>

<p>2. Consider, It is not probable that those false
Apostles mention'd, 2 <i>Cor.</i> xi. 13. erred only in
Ceremonies or Circumstances, or that their Errors,
tho' great, did proceed rather from their
Ignorance, than from the perverseness of their
minds. 1 <i>Cor.</i> iii. 15. For, for such we may
have charity and hope, that God will be merciful
unto them, if they sincerely do the best they
know, tho' they dissent in some, nay many things,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
from the practices and belief of the Christian
Church; but those St. <i>Paul</i> threatens with a
heavy curse, that their end shall be according to
their works; therefore it seems they immediately
struck at the very root and being of the Christian
Religion, and were the same with them spoken
of, 2 <i>Tim.</i> iii. 6. but with this difference, that
they did not resist, but beholding the Miracles
and Signs which were done by the true Apostle
of our Lord, wondered and believed also, and
were Baptized; yet being Sorcerers they were
unwilling to lose that great esteem they had obtained;
as it is related of <i>Simon</i>, who had bewitched
the People of <i>Samaria</i>, giving out that
he himself was some great one, to whom they all
gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying,
this Man is the great Power of God, therefore
he could not brook that <i>Peter</i> or <i>John</i> should
have a greater Power than himself; but offered
them Money, that on whomsoever he laid hands,
he (that person) should receive the Holy Ghost;
which shews him, who thus designed to make
Merchandize of the B. Spirit, tho' Baptized, to
have been no true believer, but still a Sorcerer in
the Gall of bitterness, and in the bond of Iniquity;
such were those deceitful workers, who
not being able barefaced to resist, did put on
Christianity as a Mask, that they might undermine
the truth, and introduce the Doctrines of
Devils. <i>Samaria</i> and <i>Paphos</i>, were not the only
two places where the Devil had such Agents,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
there was no part of the Earth where his Kingdom
was not Established, and where he had not
his Emissaries before the preaching of the Gospel;
and since the Text telleth us he hath his
Ministers, who do imitate their Master, by being
transformed into the Apostles of Christ, as he
himself is transformed into an [73] Angel of
light: whose design in being thus transformed,
cannot be to impose upon the Almighty; for
whatever shape he appears in, he cannot hide his
ugliness from the Eyes of him who is Omniscent,
therefore he appeareth thus in the shape of
an Angel of light, either to tempt and seduce the
blessed Spirits to rebel against God, or to ensnare
wicked Men, who by their hainous crimes (being
lovers of themselves, covetous, boasters, proud
blasphemers) were before disposed to be fit Instruments
to serve him and to enter into league
with him. Surely I, who am ignorant of the
Laws by which the Intellectual World is govern'd,
dare not affirm that it is impossible for Satan
so to appear, as to hide his deformities from
the good Angels, and under that vail to tempt
them: But certain I am that it is more consonant
to Reason, to think that the Apostles intention
here was to teach that the Devil appear'd as a
glorified Angel unto Men to gain Ministers,
whom he might imbue with the Poyson of his
Black-Art, and (when he had gotten full possession
of them) instruct them by his own Example
to transform themselves into the Apostles of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
Christ, that under that Vizard they might with
the greater Advantage promote his ends, and
join with him in doing the utmost despite to the
Spirit of Grace.</p>

<p>3. Consideration, It is against the Nature of
this Covenant, that it should be consummated by
a mental Colloquy, between the Devil and the
Witch. I know not how many Articles it consists
of, but it is certain from what has been already
proved, that the renouncing of Christ to
be the Son of God, and owning the Devil to be,
and worshipping him as God, are the two chief,
to which our Saviour who was accused of casting
out Devils by Beelzebub (<i>i. e.</i>) of being confederated
with Beelzebub, was tempted to consent:
<i>If thou be the Son of God command that these stones
be made bread</i>: And again, <i>throw thyself down
from hence, for it is written, he will give his Angels
charge over thee; and again all these things will I
give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me</i>:
Whence it is evident that here the Devil Laboured
to insinuate into our Lord, either to do
things rash and unwarrantable, or to suspect his
Sonship, revolt from God his father, and worship
Satan, that he might obtain the glory of the
World. Now it has been already said, that when
Jesus was tempted, the Devil appeared unto him
in a bodily shape; therefore it is agreeable to
Reason, that he doth appear in the same manner
to all them, whom he also tempteth to worship
him; moreover the form of renouncing a Cove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>nant
ought to bear resemblance to the form of
entring into the same Covenant; therefore Men
who are received into the Mystical Body of Christ
by God's Minister, who in God's stead expressly
covenanteth with and then Administereth the
Sacrament of Baptism unto them, must in the
like manner go out of, or renounce the said Covenant;
and of them there are [74] two sorts,
one who through the perverseness of their own
hearts, the lucre of the world, the fear of Men
more than of God, abjure their Saviour, turn
Apostates, Turks, or Pagans; The other sort is
of them who do contract with the Devil to be
his Subjects, in the imitation of whom, it is not
to be supposed that the Devil will omit any material
Circumstances, which tend both to bring
them into and confirm them in his Service. To
effect which his outward appearance, when he
receives his Catechumens is of greater force than
any mental contract, for many wicked men who
have denied God and Christ not only in their
practice, but also blasphemously in profession, yet
have repented, and at last obtained some hope of
mercy; I dare not say it is impossible for a Witch
to repent and find mercy, the secrets of the Almighty
are too high for me; but it is certain,
these wretches are strangely hardned, by what
passes between them and the Devil, in a bodily
shape, particularly their worshipping him, which
necessarily implies his outward appearance unto
them; for no man can apete Evil as Evil, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
the Law of self-preservation deeply rooted in all
men, determineth their wills to pursue that which
seems good, and fly from that which seems evil
unto them, but the inbred notions that every man
has of the Devil, is that he is an Enemy and destroyer
of mankind, therefore every man hath a Natural
aversion from him, and consequently cannot formally
worship him as such, because the object
of worship must be esteemed to be propitious
and placable by the worshippers, otherwise if fear
alone be the adequate cause of Adoration, it follows
that the Devils and damned in Hell do
worship God, which is contrary to Scripture,
which saith they blasphemed, because of their
pains, whence it follows that they who worship
the Devil must have changed the innate Idea that
they had of him, <i>viz.</i> that he is an implacable
Worrier of Men, and take him to be benign at least
to his own; but this change cannot be wrought
by any suggestion of Satan unto the minds of
Men, whom indeed he mentally tempteth to
Lust, Pride and Malice; but it is his greatest
Artifice to cause his Insinuations to arise in the
hearts of Men, as their own natural thoughts,
and if conscience discovers their Author and opposes
them, then he varnishes them over with
the specious colours of pleasure, honour and
glory; and so represents them as really good, to
be willed and desired by the Soul, which judgeth
of all things without according to the Ideas she
hath of them; but because most objects have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
two, and some many faces, and she not always
attends, therefore she often errs in her choice,
nevertheless it is impossible for her to apete an
object, whose simple Idea is Evil; but the Idea
we have of the Devil is such, for we cannot represent
him in our minds any otherwise than the
great destroyer of Men, therefore no mental
temptation can make us believe this our grand
Enemy to be [75] ever Exorable by, or in any
measure favourable to us, whence it evidently
follows, that the Devil to work this change of
opinion his worshippers have of him, must appear
unto them in a bodily shape, and impose
upon them, whom because of their great Corruption
and Sinfulness, God hath wholly left and
given up [to] strong delusions that they should
believe a lye, and the Father of lyes; who now
appearing in a humane shape, telleth them that
he is no such Monster, as he has been represented
to them by his Enemy, who calls himself God,
which Title of right belongs to him, and that
he (if they contract to be his Servants) will both
amply reward them by giving them power to do
many things very suitable to their abominable depraved
Nature, that the Christians, whatever opinion
they may pretend to have of their God, cannot
so much as pretend to, and also that he will protect
and defend them against him, whom heretofore
they have mistaken for the Almighty, and his pretended
Son Christ, whom they must abjure ere
they can be received by or expect any benefit from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
him. Upon no other consideration is it possible
for any man to worship the Devil; for the Atheists,
who deny the being of a God, do likewise
deny the existence of any Spirit good or bad;
therefore their drinking the Devils health, even
upon their knees (tho' a most horrid Crime) cannot
be construed any part of worship paid to him,
whom they assert to be a Chimera, a meer figment
of Statesmen to keep the vulgar in awe. Now I
have evinced to you that there are Witches, that
the Witch receiveth power from the Devil to do
strange things, that there is an express Covenant
between the Devil and the Witch, that this Covenant
cannot be transacted mentally, but that the
Devil must appear in a bodily shape to the Witch;
therefore I conclude, that a Witch in the Scripture
is such, who has made an Explicit Covenant
with the Devil, and is impowered by him to do
things strange in themselves, and beside their
natural course.</p>

<p>2. I perswade myself you do not expect from
me any Essay concerning the methods, how
Witches may or ought to be convinced; I wish
that those Gentlemen, whose Eminent station
both inables them to perform it, and likewise
makes it their duty so to do, may take this Province
upon them, and handle it so fully as to satisfie
you herein. I once intended to have provided
some materials for this Work, by defining four
principal things relating to Witchcraft, viz. 1.
Witch-fits. 2. The Imps that are said to attend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
on the Witch. 3. The transportation of the
Witch through the Air. 4. Lastly, the invisibility
of the Witch; but upon second thoughts
that it was foreign from my purpose, who am not
concerned to compose a just Treatise of Witchcraft,
which would require more vacant time,
than my present Circumstances will allow, only I
did promise you to give you my Opinion privately;
therefore I'le [76] venture to make use
of an Argument, which sheweth neither Art nor
Learning in the Author, and it is this, that seeing
there are Witches, and that the Law of God
doth command them to be put to death; therefore
there must be means to convict them, by
clear and certain Proof, otherwise the Law were
in vain; for no Man can be justly condemned,
who is not fairly convicted by full and certain
Evidence.</p>

<p>III. In the last place we are to inquire whether
a Witch ought to be put to death or no? you
Answer in the <i>Negative</i>; because you say that that
Law, thou shalt not suffer a Witch to live, is <i>Judicial</i>,
and extendeth only to the People of the
<i>Jews</i>; but our Saviour, or his Apostles have not
delivered any where any such command, therefore
they ought to be suffered to live, this indeed
seems somewhat plausible at first view, but upon
through Examination hath no weight in it at all
for these Reasons, 1. All Penal Laws receive
their Sanction from him or them, who have the
Sovereign Power in any state, as thou shalt not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
commit Adultery, is a Moral-law, and obligatory
over the Consciences of Men in all places and
Ages; but the Adulterers shall be put to death is
a judicial law, and in force only in that state,
where it is enacted by the Sovereign. 2. The
Government of the <i>Jews</i> was a Theocracy, and
God himself did condescend to be their King,
not only as he is King of Kings; for in that
sense he is, always was, and ever will be supreme
Lord, and Governour of all his Creatures; but in
an especial manner to give them Laws for the
Government of their State, and to protect them
against their Enemies; in one word to be immediately
their Sovereign. 3. Our Saviour's Kingdom
was not of this World, he was no Judge to
divide so much as an Inheritance between two
Brethren; nay, he himself submitted patiently to
the unjust Sentence of the Governour of the
Country in which he lived; therefore both the
rewards and punishments annexed to his Laws are
Spiritual, and then shall have their full accomplishment,
when the Son of Man at the last day
shall pronounce, <i>Come unto me ye blessed, and depart
ye cursed into Everlasting fire</i>. 4. That Soveraigns,
who have received the Gospel of our Lord, have
not therefore lost their Power of enacting Laws
for the ruling and preserving their People, and
punishing Malefactors even with Death; so that
the Criminal is as justly condemned to die by our
Municipal, as he was heretofore by the Judicial
Law among the Jews: How much more then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
ought our Law to advert against the highest of
all Criminals, those execrable Men and Women,
who tho yet alive, have listed themselves under
Satan's banner, and explicitly Sworn Allegiance
to him, to fight against God and Christ; indeed
all unholy Men afford great matter to the Devils
of Blaspheming, but these wretches have confederated
themselves with the Devils, to blaspheme
and destroy all they can; and do you think that
these common [<a id="a77a"></a>77] Enemies of God and Mankind
ought to be suffered to live in a Christian
Common wealth, especially considering that we
have a President of putting them to death from
God himself, when he acted as King over his
own peculiar People. But methinks I hear you
saying, all this doth not satisfie me, for I am sure
nothing can be added to the Devils malice, and if
he could, he certainly would appear and frighten
all Men out of their wits. I answer, 1. We
must not reject a truth, because we cannot resolve
all the Questions that may be proposed about it;
otherwise all our Science must be turned into
Scepticism, for we have not a comprehensive
knowledge of any one thing. 2. When you say,
that if the Devil could, he would appear and
frighten all Men; the Lawful consequence is not
that he cannot appear at all, for we have undoubtedly
proved the contrary; but that we are
Ignorant of the bounds that the Almighty hath
set to him, whose malice indeed, if he were not
restrain'd, is so great as to destroy all Men; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
the goodness of our God is greater, who hath
given us means to escape his fury, if we will give
earnest heed to the Gospel of our Saviour, which
only is able to comfort us against the sad and
miserable condition of our present state, for not
only the Devils, but likewise all do conspire
against us to work our ruine. The deluge came
and swept away all the race (save eight persons)
of mankind: the Fire will in time devour what
the Water has left, and all this cometh to pass
because of Sin; but we who have received the
Lord Jesus, look for new Heavens, and a new
Earth, wherein dwelleth Righteousness. Therefore
he, if we purifie ourselves as he is pure, will
save us (for when he appears we shall be made
like unto him; to whom be Glory for ever, <i>Amen</i>)
from the great destruction that must come upon
all the World, and the Inhabitants thereof. Farewell.</p>

<p>
<i>Worthy Sir</i>,
</p>

<p class="dropcap">T<i>HE great pains you have taken for my Information
and Satisfaction in those controverted
points relating to Witchcraft, whether it attain the
end or not, cannot require less than suitable acknowledgments
and gratitude, especially considering you
had no particular obligation of office to it, and when
others, whose proper Province it was had declined it.
It is a great truth,</i> [<i>that the many Heresies among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
the Christians</i> (<i>nor the lying Miracles, or Witchcrafts
used by some to induce to the worship of
Images, &amp;c.</i>)<i> must not give a Mortal wound to
Christianity or Truth;</i>] <i>but the great question in
these con</i>[78]<i>troverted points still is, what is truth.
And in this search being agreed in the Judge or
Rule, there is great hopes of the Issue. That there
are Witches is plain from that Rule of Truth, the
Scriptures, which commands their punishment by
Death. But what that Witchcraft is, or wherein
it does consist is the whole difficulty. That head cited
from Mr.</i> Gaule,<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> <i>and so well proved thereby (not
denied by any) makes the work yet shorter; so that it
is agreed to consist in a Malignity, &amp;c. and seeking
by a sign to seduce, &amp;c. not excluding any other sorts
or branches, when as well proved by that infallible
Rule. That good Angels have appeared, is certain,
tho that instance of those to</i> Abraham <i>may admit of
a various construction; some Divines supposing them
to be the Trinity, others that they were Men-messengers,
as</i> Judges ii. 1. <i>and others that they were
Angels; but tho this as I said might admit of a
debate, yet I see no question of the Angel Gabriel's
appearance, particularly to the B. Virgin; for tho
the Angels are Spirits, and so not perceptible by our
bodily Eyes without the appointment of the most high,
yet he who made all things by his word in the Creation,
can with a word speak things into Being. And
whether the Angels did assume matter</i> (<i>or a Vehicle</i>)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span><i>and by that appear to the bodily Eye; or whether
by the same word there were an Idea fram'd in the
mind, which needed no Vehicle to represent them to
the Intellects, is with the All-wise, and not for me
to dispute. If we poor shallow Mortals do not comprehend
the manner how, that argues only our weakness.
Two other times did this glorious Angel appear.</i>
Dan. viii. 16. Dan. ix. 21. <i>The first of these
times was in Vision, as by the text and context will
appear. The second was the same as at the first;
which being considered, as it will ascertain that
Angels have appear'd; so that 'tis at the will of
the Sender how they shall appear, whether to the
bodily Eye, or Intellect only.</i> Mat. i. 20. <i>The
appearance of the Angel to Joseph was in a Dream,
and yet a real appearance; so was there a real appearance
to the Apostle, but whether in the body or
out of the body he could not tell; and that they are
sent and come not of their own motion.</i> Luke i. 26.
<i>And in the sixth Month the Angel Gabriel was sent
from God.</i> Dan. ix. 23. <i>At the beginning of thy
supplication the commandment came forth, and I am
come,</i> v. 21. <i>Being caused to fly swiftly, &amp;c. but
from these places may be set down as undoubted
truths or conclusions,</i></p>

<p>1. <i>That the glorious Angels have their Mission and
Commission from the most high.</i></p>

<p>2. <i>That without this they cannot appear to mankind.
And from these two will necessarily flow a
third.</i></p>

<p>3. <i>That if the glorious Angels have not that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
power to go till commissioned, or to appear to Mortals,
then not the fallen Angels; who are held in Chains
of darkness, to the Judgment of the great day.
Therefore to argue, that because the good Angels
have appeared, the evil may or can, is to me as if&mdash;</i>[79]
<i>because the dead have been raised to life by Holy
Prophets, therefore Men, wicked Men can raise the
dead. As the sufferings, so the temptations of our
Saviour were (in degree) beyond those common to
Man; he being the second Adam, or publick head,
the strongest assaults were now improved; and we
read that he was tempted, that he might be able to
succour those that are tempted, as also that he was
led of the Spirit into the Wilderness, that he might be
tempted, &amp;c. But how the tempter appeared to him
who was God Omniscient; whether to the bodily Eye
or to the Intellect, is as far beyond my cognizance as
for a blind Man to judge of Colours. But from the
whole set down this fourth conclusion</i>,</p>

<p>4. <i>That when the Almighty free Agent has a
work to bring about for his own glory, or Man's
good; he can Imploy not only Blessed Angels, but the
evil ones in it, as 2 Cor. xii. 7.</i> And lest I should be
exalted above measure, there was given to me a
thorn in the flesh, the Messenger of Satan to
buffet me. 1. Sam. 10. xiv, xv, xxiii. <i>An evil
Spirit from the Lord troubled him. It is a great truth,
we understand little, very little, and that in common
things, how much less then in spirituals, such as are
above humane cognizance. But tho' upon the strictest
Scrutiny in some natural things, we can only discover
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
our own Ignorance, yet we must not hence deny what we
do know, or suffer a Rape to be committed upon our
Reason and Senses in the Dark; and say that the
Devil by his ordinary Power can act a Vehicle (i. e.)
some matter distinct from himself, who is wholly a
Spirit, and yet this matter not to be felt nor heard,
and at the same time to be seen; or may be felt, and
not heard nor seen, &amp;c. seems to me to be a Chimera,
invented at first to puzzle the belief of reasonable
Creatures, and since Calculated to a Roman Latitude,
to uphold the Doctrine of Transubstantiation; who
teach, that under the Accidents of Bread, is contained
the Body of our Saviour, his humane Body, as long, and
as broad, &amp;c. for here the Power of the Almighty
must not be confined to be less than the Devil's, and
'tis he that has said,</i> hoc est meum Corpus. <i>As to
the consent of almost all Ages, I meddle not now with
it, but come to the fifth Conclusion.</i></p>

<p>5. <i>That when the Divine Being will imploy the
Agency of Evil Spirits for any service, 'tis with him
the manner how they shall exhibit themselves, whether
to the bodily Eye, or Intellect only; and whether
it shall be more or less formidable&mdash;To deny these
three last were to make the Devil an Independent
Power and consequently a God. As to the nature
of possessions by Evil Spirits, for the better understanding
of it, it may be needful to compare it with
its contraries; and to instance in</i> Samson, <i>of whom
it was foretold, that he should begin to deliver</i> Israel,
and how was he inabled to this work? Judges xiii.
25. <i>The Spirit of the Lord began to move him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
at times in the Camp, &amp;c. ch.</i> xv. 13, 14. v. and
they bound him with two new cords, and brought
him up from the rock, and when they came to
Lehi, [80] the Philistines shouted against him,
and the Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon
him, and the cords that were upon his Arms
became as Flax, that was burnt with fire, and his
bands loosed from his hands, <i>&amp;c. I might instance
further, but this may suffice to show that he
had more than a natural strength, as also whence his
strength was, viz. he was impowered by the Spirit
from God. And now will any say, that it was not
Samson, but the Spirit that did these things, or that
there being things done, bonds broken, &amp;c. by a force
that could not proceed from human strength, and that
therefore the Spirit entered into him otherwise qualified
than as meer Spirit; or that the Spirit entered
not without some Portion of Matter, and by the Intermediation
thereof acted</i> Samson's <i>body. If any
say this and more too, this doth not alter the truth,
which remains, viz. that the Spirit of God did inable</i>
Samson <i>to the doing of things beyond his Natural
strength. And now what remains but upon
parity of Reason, to apply this to the case of Possession,
which may be summ'd up in this sixth Conclusion.</i></p>

<p>6. <i>That God for wise ends, only known to himself,
may and has impowered Devils to Possess and
strangely to act humane Bodies, even to the doing
of things beyond the Natural strength of that body.
And for any to tell of a Vehicle, or matter used in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
it, I must observe that General Rule</i>, Colos. ii. 8.
Beware lest any spoil you through Philosophy and
vain deceit, after the tradition of Men, after the
Rudiments of the World, and not after Christ.
<i>To come next to that of Witchcraft, and here taking
that cited head of Mr.</i> Gaul, <i>to be uncontroverted,
set it as a seventh Conclusion</i>.</p>

<p>7. <i>That Witchcraft consists in a maligning and
oppugning the Word, Work and Worship of God,
and seeking by any extraordinary sign to seduce any
from it. Deut.</i> xiii. 12. <i>Matt.</i> xxiv. 24. <i>Acts</i> xiii.
8. 10. 2 <i>Tim.</i> iii. 8. <i>Do but mark well the places,
and for this very property of thus opposing and perverting,
they are all there concluded arrant and absolute
Witches; and it will be easily granted, that the same
that is call'd Witch, is call'd a false Christ, a false
Prophet, and a Sorcerer, and that the terms are
Synonimous; and that what the Witches aim at is, to
seduce the People to seek after other Gods. But
here the Question will be, whether the Witch do really
do things strange in themselves, and beyond their
natural course, and all this by a Power immediately
from the Devil. In this inquiry, as we have nothing
to do with unwritten verities, so but little with
Cabalistick Learning, which might perhaps but lead
us more astray, as in the Instance of their charging
our Saviour with casting out Devils by Beelzebub, his
Answer is, if Satan be divided against himself, his
Kingdom hath an end: But seeing all are agreed,
set this eighth Conclusion.</i></p>

<p>8. <i>That God will not give his testimony to a lye.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
To say that God did at any time impower a Witch
to work Wonders, to gain belief to the Doctrine of
Devils, were with one breath to destroy root and
branch of all revealed Re</i>[81]<i>ligion. And hence
'tis clear the Witch has no such wonder-working
power from God; and must we then conclude she has
such a Miraculous Power from the Devil; if so,
then it follows that either God gives the Devil leave
to impower the Witch to make use of this Seal, in
order to deceive, or else that the Devil has this
Power independent of himself;</i><a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>
<i>to assert the first of
these were in effect to say, that tho God will not give
his testimony to a lye, yet that he may impower the
Devil to set to God's own Seal, in order to deceive;
and what were this but to overthrow all revealed
Religion. The last if asserted must be to own the
Devil to be an unconquered Enemy, and consequently
a Sovereign Deity, and deserving much thanks, that
he exerts his Power no more. Therefore in this
Dilemma it is Wisdom for shallow Mortals to have
recourse to their only guide, and impartially to inquire,
whether the Witches really have such a Miraculous
or Wonder-working Power? And 'tis
remarkable that the Apostle,</i> Gal. v. 20. <i>reckons up
<span class="err" title="original: Withcraft">Witchcraft</span> among the Works of the flesh, which were
it indeed a Wonder-working Power, received immediately
from the Devil, and wholly beyond the Power
of Nature; it were very improper to place it with
<span class="errauthor" title="read: Drunkenness">Drunkennness</span>, Murthers, Adulteries, &amp;c. all manifest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
fleshly works. 'Tis also remarkable, that Witchcraft
is generally in Scripture joined with spiritual
Whordom, i. e. Idolatry. This thence will plainly
appear to be the same, only pretending to a sign, in
order to deceive, seems to be yet a further degree, and
in this sense</i> Manassah <i>and</i> Jezebel, 2 <i>Chron.</i> xxxiii.
6. 2 <i>Kings</i> ix. 22. <i>used Witchcraft and Whoredoms,
Nahum</i> iii. 4. <i>The Idolatrous City is called
Mistress of Witchcrafts. But to instance in one place
instead of many, that</i> 2 <i>Thes.</i> ii. <i>from the</i> 3 <i>to the</i> 12
v. <i>particularly</i> 9 <i>and</i> 10 v. Even him whose coming
is after the working of Satan, with all power and
signs, and lying wonders, and with all deceivableness.
And for this cause God shall send them
strong delusions that they should believe a lye,
that they all might be damned, who believe not
the truth, <i>&amp;c. This, that then was spoken in the
Prophesie of that man of Sin, that was to appear,
how abundantly does History testifie the fulfilment of
it; particularly to seduce to the Worship of Images:
Have not the Images been made to move? to smile,
&amp;c. too tedious were it to mention the hundredth
part of what undoubted History doth abundantly
testifie. And hence do set down this nineth Conclusion.</i></p>

<p>9. <i>That the Man of Sin, or Seducer, &amp;c. makes
use of lying wonders to the end to deceive, and that
God in Righteous Judgment</i>, may send strong delusions
that they should believe a lye, that they
might be damn'd, who believe not the truth, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>

<i>'Tis certain that the Devil is a proud Being,
and would be thought to have a Power equal to the
Almighty; and it cannot but be very grateful to
him to see Mortals charging one another of doing
such works by the Devil's Power, as in truth is the
proper prerogative of the Almighty, Omnipotent Being.
The</i> [82] <i>next head should have been about an
Explicit Covenant, between the Witch and the Devil,
&amp;c. But in this, the whole of it, I cannot perswade
myself but you must be sensible of an apparent
leaning to Education</i> (<i>or tradition</i>) <i>the Scriptures
being wholly silent in it; and supposing this to
fall in as a dependent on what went before shall say
the less to it; for if the Devil has no such Power
to communicate, upon such compact, then the whole is
a fiction; tho I cannot but acknowledge you have
said so much to uphold that Doctrine, that I know
not how any could have done more; however, as I
said, I find not myself ingaged</i> (<i>unless Scripture
proof were offered</i>) <i>to meddle with it. For as you
have in such cases your Reason for your guide, so I
must be allowed to use that little that I have, do only
say that as God is a Spirit, so he must be worship'd
in spirit and truth. So also that the Devil is a
Spirit, and that his rule is in the hearts of the Children
of Disobedience, and that an Explicit Covenant
of one Nature or another can have little force,
any further than as the heart is engaged in it. And
so I pass to the last, viz. Whether a Witch ought
to be put to death. And without accumulation of
the offence do Judge, that where the Law of any
Countrey is to punish by death such as seduce and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
tempt to the worship of strange Gods</i> (<i>or idols, or
Statues</i>) <i>by as good Authority may they</i> (<i>no doubt</i>)
<i>punish these as Capital Offenders, who are distinguished
by that one remove, viz. to their seducing is
added a sign, i. e. they pretend to a sign in order to
seduce. And thus worthy Sir, I have freely given
you my thoughts upon yours, which you so much
obliged me with the sight of and upon the whole, tho
I cannot in the general but commend your Caution in
not asserting many things contended for by others;
yet must say, that in my esteem there is retain'd so
much as will secure all the rest;</i> (<i>to instance</i>) <i>if a
Spirit has a Vehicle, i. e. some portion of matter
which it acts, &amp;c. hence as necessarily may be inferred
that Doctrine of</i> Incubus <i>and</i> Succubus, <i>and
why not also that of Procreation by Spirits both
good and bad? Thus was</i> Alexander <i>the</i> Great, <i>the</i>
Brittish Merlin,<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> <i>and</i> Martin Luther, <i>and many
others said to be begotten. Again if the Witch has
such a Wonder-working Power, why not to afflict?
will not the Devil thus far gratifie her? And
have none this Miraculous Power, but the Covenanting
Witch? then the offence lyes in the Covenant,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
then 'tis not only hard, but Impossible to find a
Witch by such Evidence as the Law of God requires;
for it will not be supposed that they call
Witness to this Covenant; therefore it will here be
necessary to admit of such as the nature of such
Covenant will bear</i> (<i>as Mr.</i> Gaul <i>hath it in his 5th
head, i. e.</i>) <i>the testimony of the afflicted, with their
Spectral sight, to tell who afflicts themselves or
others; the experiment of saying the Lords Prayer,
falling at the sight, and rising at the touch, searching
for Tets</i> (<i>i. e. Excrescencies of Nature</i>) <i>strange
and foreign stories of the Death of some Cattle, or
over-setting some Cart; and what can Juries have
better to guide them to find out this Covenant by.</i></p>

<p>[<a id="a83a"></a>83] <i>'Tis matter of lamentation, and let it be for
a lamentation, to consider how these things have
open'd the Floodgates of Malice, Revenge, Uncharitableness,

<p>
<small>SIR,</small>
</p>

<p class="dropcap">SINCE your design of giving Copies of our
Papers (if not to the publick at least) out of
your hands, I find myself obliged to make a Reply
to your Answer, lest silence should be construed
an Assent to the positions whereby (I
think) truth would be scandaliz'd. I remember
that some have taught that it is not certain there
is any such thing really in being as matter; because
the Ideas which we have of our own, and
all other bodies, may be caused to arise in us by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
God, without the real existence of the objects
they represent. But this opinion is not only absurd
and false, but likewise Atheistical, destroying
the veracity of the Almighty, whom it asserts
to have determined us by a fatal necessity to believe
things to be, which are not; and I wonder
that you should allude unto it, because that Angels
have appeared in a Dream, in a vision; for
we dream also of Trees, Birds, &amp;c. are there
therefore no such things in nature, because we
sometimes Dream to see and hear them, when we
are asleep? St. <i>Paul</i> in his Vision was so far
from believing the Objects that were represented
to him, to come by the intermedium of his
Senses, that he declares, he [84] does not know
whether he was in the body, or out of the body;
therefore the Instance is in no wise proper. For
<i>Abraham</i> and the B. Virgin did see and hear; and
if there were not such things really, as were represented
to them by their Senses, they were deluded,
by being made to believe they saw and
heard what was not. There is none who denieth
God causing thoughts to arise in Mens minds:
but thence to infer he maketh Objects which are
not, by forming their Ideas in our minds, to
appear to us through the Ministry of our Senses
as though they were, is a piece not only of vain,
but very dangerous Philosophy. It is true, the
good Angels will not appear without the appointment
of God, they will not do any one Action,
but according to the laws he has prescribed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
them. But you say they cannot (which does not
follow from your premises) supposing their not
appearing to proceed from the defect of their
power, and not the rectitude of their will, which
fallacy has deceived you into a third Conclusion.
For the fallen Angels are not so held under
Chains of darkness; but that they can and do go
to [and] fro on the earth seeking whom they may
devour. Before their fall they could have appeared
if sent, and would not then do any thing
without a Divine Command But now they have
rebell'd against God, and do all they can to despise
him, therefore their not appearing now (if
it were true they never did, they never shall appear)
must proceed from a restraint they are
under, which is accidental, not Essential to their
nature; so that the true Conclusion is, the fallen
Angels, while they are under forcible restraint
from God to the contrary cannot appear. But
what this (being cleared from the Ambiguity
you express it in) maketh to the purpose I know
not, unless God had promised for a determinate
time to detain them under this restraint. I do
not understand what you intend by the dead
being raised by Holy Men; the most natural
inference is, that in imitation of them wicked
men by their Inchantments calling on a <i>Dæmon</i>
to appear in the shape of the dead, will pretend
that they also can raise the dead. The <i>Romanists</i>
are much obliged to you for making Transubstantiation
(so much contended for by them) to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
of as old a date as the appearance of Devils, and
that the one implieth no more contradiction than
the other: If so we do well to think seriously
whether we are not guilty of great sin in separating
from them; for certainly whatever private
Mens Notions in this Age may be, yet it is
matter of great moment, that all Antiquity (the
<i>Saducees</i> the Elder Brethren of our Hobbists<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>
excepted) hath believed the appearance of Evil
Spirits and their Illusions. I should be too officious
if I offered to explain, how matter, real
matter may fall under the cognisance of one of
our senses, and not the rest. It is for you to shew
the impossibility thereof, if you will build any
thing upon your Assertion, to prove which your
first Argument is (it seems to me) a Chimera,
which [85] is not enough, when there are many
to whom it seems to be a truth: Your second is
very dangerous, and highly derogatory of the
honour of God, between whom and the Devil
you make comparison more than once as the
power of the Almighty must not be confined to
be less than the Devils. And again, to deny
these three last were to make the Devil an Independent
Power and consequently a God. These
expressions (which cannot but be very pleasing to
the Devil, who vainly boasts himself to be a Being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
without dependance) are altogether groundless,
and very unmeet to proceed from a Christian:
Consider what you are a doing, to establish a Doctrine
(the contrary whereof the greatest part of
mankind does believe) you run upon such precipices,
as if you are mistaken, and that is not
impossible, must totally destroy all Religion,
Natural and Revealed; for suppose it were generally
believed according to you, that the Devil
cannot appear, because if he could he must be a
God, independent, an unconquer'd enemy, and
he doth appear to us as we hear he hath to multitudes,
both of the past and present ages: In
such a case what remains for us to do; but to fall
down and worship him. Upon the head of
possession, you have recourse to that instance of
<i>Samson</i>, who was impowered by God, to the
doing of things beyond the Natural strength of
common Men, and thence you say, we may least
learn the Nature of Possession by evil Spirits,
this comparison is indeed very odious, and I had
rather think you have fallen into it unawares;
for what greater Blasphemy than that God and
the Devil do act the bodies, which the one and
the other do possess in the same manner; if the
hypothesis I laid down had not pleased you, yet
you ought not (for fear of being deceiv'd by vain
Philosophy, to have run so horrible an extream,
as to assimulate God's manner of working to the
Devils, which necessarily implies, that either
their Powers are equal, or at least that they do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
not differ in kind but in degree only; than which
nothing can be more impious or absurd; for the
most possibly perfect Creature, is infinitely distant
from the Creator, and there can be no Comparison
between them. On the head of Witchcraft,
you acknowledge the Witch has not his Wonder-working
Power from God; but then you
say, the Devil has no such power to give; for if
he had, he must be&mdash;&mdash;This way of reasoning
as I noted before, is very dangerous, and I think
ought not to be used; besides there is a great
fallacy in your Dilemma; which because I perceive,
you lay the whole weight of the matter
upon it, I will evince unto you. The Devil tho
superlatively Arrogant and Proud, nevertheless
depends on the first cause for his being, and all
his Powers, without whose Influx he or any
other Creature cannot subsist a moment, but
must either return to their primitive Nothing, or
be continually preserved by the same Power, by
the which they were at first produced; therefore
the [86] Beings and Powers of all Creatures
(because they immediately flow from God) are
good, and consequently the simple Actions, as
they proceed from those Powers, are in their own
nature likewise good, the Evil proceeding only
from the Rebellious will of the Creature, wherefore
'tis no Paradox, but a certain truth, that the
same action in respect to the first cause is good,
but in respect of the second is Evil; for instance,
the act of Copulation is in itself good, instituted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
by God, and may be willed and desired by the
Soul, which sinneth not for exerting the simple
act; but for exerting it contrary to the Laws
prescribe'd by God: as in Wedlock and Adultery
there is the same special natural Action,
which consider'd simply, as flowing from a
Power given to Man by God is certainly good;
but considered with relation to the rebellious
will of the Adulterer (who lieth with his Neighbours
Wife, whom he is forbad to touch) is a
very great Evil. We may say the same of all
humane Actions, the Executioner and the Murtherer
do the same natural Act of striking and
killing: The difference consists in the rectitude
of the ones and depravation of the others will.
These things premised, what more reason have
we to conclude that the Devil (because he shews
signs and wonders to gain belief to lyes, which is
very contrary to the will of God) must be therefore
an Independent Power; than that the Adulterer,
the Murtherer, or any other sinner (because their
Actions being Evil, of which God cannot be the
cause) must be Independent beings: The deceit
of the last is very palpable, and I doubt not you
will readily acknowledge it, for it is obvious
from what has been said to the meanest Capacity,
to distinguish between the Action itself,
which is good, and flows from God, and the
Circumstances of the Action, the choice whereof
proceeds from the Iniquity of the Will, wherein
doth solely consist the Sin; the parallel is so exact,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
that I cannot see the least shadow of reason,
why we ought not in like manner to distinguish
whatever effect is produced by the Devil; to
whom (as to Man) God having given Powers,
and a Will to Rule them Powers, is truly and
properly the cause of all the Actions (in a Natural,
but not Moral Sense) that flow from the
Powers he has given. Therefore the Wonder-working
Power of the Devil, and the effects
thereof, considered as Acts of one of God's Creatures,
are not Evil but Good; the using that
Power (which proceeds from the Rebellion of
Satan) to bear testimony to a lye, is that one,
which constitutes the Evil thereof.</p>

<p>And now I have done with your Argument,
wherein you have indeed shewn great skill and
dexterity in turning to your Advantage, what
being fairly stated makes against you, as the Appearance
of Angels, <i>&amp;c.</i> observing nicely the rules
of Art, and particularly that grand one of concealing,
nay dissembling the same Art, as when
you quote that Scripture [<a id="a87a"></a>87] concerning vain
Philosophy (of which tho altogether foreign from
the matter in hand yet) you intend to serve yourself
with the Unthinking, who measure the Sense
of words by their Jingle, not knowing how to
weigh the things they signifie, and truly herein
your end is very Artificial; for you intend both
to throw dirt at them that differ from you, and
at the same time to cover yourself with such
a subtle web, through which you may see, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
not be seen. What follows, is rather a Rhetorical
Lecture, such as the Patriots of Sects (who commonly
Explain the Holy Scriptures according to
their own Dogma's, and so obtrude humane Invention
for the pure word of God) use with their
Auditors, to recommend any Principle they have
a mind to establish, than an Impartial and through
disquisition of a controverted point; wherefore I
do not think myself obliged to take any further
notice of it; especially seeing truth, which for
the most part is little regarded in such florid Discourses,
and not any prejudice of Education, Interest,
or Party, did set me about this subject. I
have never been used to Complement in points of
Controversy, therefore I hope you'l not be angry,
because I have given you my thoughts naked and
plain. I have not the least motion in my mind
of accusing you of any formal design to injure
Religion; I only observe unto you, that your
over eager contention to maintain your Principle,
has hurried you to assert many things of much
greater danger, both in themselves and their consequences,
than those you would seem to avoid;
which do amount to no more than that, Men
being (in the ordinary course of Providence) the
Depositories of both Divine and Humane Laws,
may (instead of using them to preserve) pervert
them to destroy; which indeed is very lamentable.</p>

<p>But it is the inevitable consequent of our depraved
nature, and cannot be wholly remedied,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
till Sin, and the grand Author of Sin, the Devil,
be entirely conquered, and God be all in all; to
whom, with the Son, and Holy Ghost, be glory
for ever, <i>Amen</i>.</p>

<p>
<i>Worthy Sir</i>,
</p>

<p class="dropcap">YOURS of <i>July</i> 25, being in some sort surprising
to me, I could do no less than say
somewhat, as well to vindicate myself from those
many Reflections, mistakes and hard censures
therein; as also to vindicate what I conceive to
be Important truth, and to that end find it needful
to repeat some part of mine, <i>Viz.</i> Conclusion.</p>

<p>[88] 1. That the glorious Angels have their
Mission and Commission from the most High.</p>

<p>2. That without this they cannot appear to
mankind.</p>

<p>3. That if the glorious Angels have not that
power to go till commission'd, or to appear to
Mortals, then not the fallen Angels, who are held
in Chains of Darkness to the Judgment of the
great Day.</p>

<p>4. That when the Almighty free Agent has a
work to bring about for his own glory, or Mans
good, he can employ not only the Blessed Angels,
but evil ones in it.</p>

<p>5. That when the Divine Being will imploy
the Agency of Evil Spirits for any service, 'tis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
with him the manner how they shall exhibit
themselves, whether to the bodily Eye, or Intellect
only, or whether it shall be more or less formidable.</p>

<p>To deny these three last, were to make the
Devil an Independent Power, and consequently a
God.</p>

<p>The bare recital of these is sufficient to vindicate
me from that reitterated charge, of denying
all appearances of Angels or Devils.</p>

<p>That the good Angels cannot appear without
Mission and Commission from the most high, is
you say more than follows from the premises;
but if you like not such Negative deduction,
though so natural, it concerns you (if you will
assert this Power to be in their Natures, and their
non appearance only to proceed from the rectitude
of their wills, and that without such Commission
they have a Power to appear to Mortals,
and upon this to build so prodigious a Structure,
<i>&amp;c.</i>) very clearly to prove it by Scripture, for
Christians have good reason to take the Apostles
warning (if some Philosophers have taught that
Man is nothing but matter. And others that 'tis
not certain there is any Matter at all) <i>to take heed
least they should be spoiled through vain Philosophy,
&amp;c.</i> but that this should be alluded to by such as
never heard of either Notion, or that it was asserted
that those real appearances to <i>Joseph</i>, and
to the Apostle, was through the Ministry of the
Senses, is as vain as such Philosophy. As to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
Dead being raised, had I used Art or Rhetorick
enough to explain my meaning to you, I needed
not now to rejoin. That 'tis as good an Argument
to say, that because Holy Prophets have
raised the dead, therefore wicked Men have a
Power to raise the dead: As 'tis to say, because
good Angels have appeared, therefore the Evil
have a Power to appear; for who can doubt, but
if the Almighty shall Commissionate a wicked
Man to it, he also shall raise the dead, as is intimated,
<i>Mat.</i> vii. 22. <i>And in thy name done many
wonderful Works.</i> As to comparisons being odious,
particularly that concerning <i>Samson</i>, I think
it needful here to add these Scriptures further to
confirm the fourth Conclusion. 2 <i>Sam.</i> xxiv. 1.
compared with 1 <i>Chron.</i> xxi. 1. <i>In one 'tis God
moved, &amp;c. and in the o</i>[89]<i>ther Satan provoked</i>
David <i>to number the People</i>. 2 Chron. xviii. 21.
<i>And the Lord said, thou shalt intice him, and thou
shalt also prevail, go out and do even so</i>; all which,
with many more that might be produc'd, as they
will shew the truth of the Conclusion; so that
'tis no odious comparison to say, that as the Almighty
can make use of Good, so also of Evil
Spirits, for the accomplishing of his own wise
ends, and can impower either without the help
of a Vehicle. For possessions must be numbred
among Gods afflictive dispensations, who also orders
all the Circumstances thereof. But if any
object God is not the Author of Evil, <i>&amp;c.</i> you
have furnish'd me with a very learned Answer, by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
distinguishing between the Act and the Evil of
the Act, and to which 'tis adapt, but will no wise
sute where it is placed, till it be first proved that
the Devil hath of himself such Power not only
of appearing at pleasure, but of working Miracles,
and to the Almighty reserved only the power
of restraining; for till this be proved the Dilemma
must remain stable. He that asserts that&mdash;Because
good Angels have appeared, that therefore
the fallen Angels have a Power of themselves
to appear to Mortals; And that they cannot be
employed by the Almighty; nor that he does not
order the manner and Circumstances of such
appearance, what doth he less than make the
Devil an Independent Power, and consequently a
God! So he that asserts that the Devil hath a
Power of himself, and Independent to work
Wonders, and Miracles, and to impower Witches
to do like in order to deceive, <i>&amp;c.</i> What doth
he less than own him to be an unconquered
Enemy, and consequently a Sovereign Deity!<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> and
who is it that is culpable? he that ascribes such
Attributes to the Evil one, or he that asserts that
the so doing gives him (or ascribes to him) such
Power as is the prerogative of him only who is
Almighty? and here Sir, it highly concerns you
to consider your foundations, what proof from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>Scripture is to be found for your Assertions, and
who it is you are contending for. For hitherto
nothing like a proof hath been offer'd from
Scripture, which abounds so with the contrary,
that he that runs may read, <i>As shall there be evil
in the City, and the Lord hath not done it? who is
he that saith, and it cameth to pass when the Lord
commandeth it not</i>. Who among the Gods of the
Heathen (of which the Devil is one) can give
Rain, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>But I shall not be tedious in multiplying proofs,
to that which all seem to own. For as to that
stale plea of Universality, do say that I have read
of one, if not several, general Councels, that have
not only disapproved, but Anathematiz'd them
that have ascribed such Power to the Devils.
And several National Protestant Churches at this
day in their Exhortation before the Sacrament
(among other Enormous Crimes) admonish all
that believe any such Power in the Witch, <i>&amp;c.</i> to
withdraw as unmeet to partake at the Lord's
Table.</p>

<p>[90] And I believe Christians in general, if
they were asked, would own that what Powers
the Devil may at any time have to appear, to
afflict, destroy, or cause tempests, <i>&amp;c.</i> must be by
Power or Commission from the Sovereign Being.
And that having such a Commission, not only
Hail, but Frogs, Lice, or Flies shall be impowered
to plague a great King and Kingdom. And if
so, this Sandy Structure of the Devils appearance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
and working Wonders at pleasure, and of Impowering
Witches to afflict, <i>&amp;c.</i> (for to this
narrow Crisis is that whole Doctrine reduc'd) the
whole disappears at the first shaking.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>Thus worthy Sir, I have given you my sentiments,
and the grounds thereof, as plainly and as
concise as I was able, tho 'tis indeed a subject that
calls for the ablest Pens to discuss, acknowledging
myself to be insufficient for these things; however
I think I have done but my duty for the
glory of God, the Sovereign Being; and have
purposely avoided such a reply as some parts of
yours required.</p>

<p>And pray that not only you and I, but all mankind
may give to the Almighty the glory due
unto his name. From, Sir, Yours to Command,</p>

of these Letters I have met
with is contained in the Answer to
the <i>More Wonders</i>, by Dr. Mather,
and is in this Passage: "The <i>Anti-scriptural
Doctrines</i> espoused by this
Man [Calef] do also call for no <i>further
Answer</i>; for a certain <i>Scotchman</i>
(one Stuart) of no very great
Circumstances, aboard one of our
Frigates then in our Harbour, sent
him <i>Two Letters</i>, which he has
been so silly as to insert in his
wretched Volume." This "one
Stuart" was, perhaps, Chaplain on
board the Man-of-war. The Doctor
thinks Mr. Calef was very silly
to print the Letters, because they
were, in his Judgment, a complete
Vindication of Witchcraft. Mr.
Calef was willing all should be said
on that side that could be said. He
felt fully convinced that,

There, however, seems to
have been, at some remote Period,
a Man named <i>Ambrose Merlin</i>,
living in Carmarthenshire, in Wales;
and it will pay the Reader well to
turn to Thomas Fuller, and see what
he says about him in his <i>Worthies</i>,
Vol. III, 524. Among other things
he says: "His Extraction is very
Incredible, reported to have an Incubus
to his Father, pretending to
a Pedigree older than Adam, even
from the Serpent himself. But a
learned Pen demonstrateth the Impossibility
of such Conjunctions.
And let us not load Satan with
groundless Sins, whom I believe the
Father of Lies, but no Father of Bastards."

among many weak ones,
about the Existence of Witches.
He says: "Those Opinions or
Diseases of the Brain which Witches
have, who think they go to Feasts
and Dancings, upon their talking
of it to others, that are of a timorous
Disposition and weak Brains,
bring others into the same Fits of
Fury, and, like a Contagion, spread
far and near, infesting many Heads;
though it is observable those Diseases
are more frequent amongst the
Inhabitants of Mountains and solitary
Places, than amongst those that
live in Cities." It must occur to
the judicious Reader, that Mons.
Le Clerc took a roundabout Way
to tell him that Witchcraft flourished
best among ignorant People. See

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
